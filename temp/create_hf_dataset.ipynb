That said, I am not good at working out just for the sake\\nof working out. But give me short windows with specific\\ntargets and I get very excited about getting myself in great\\nshape. I try to hit a certain number—of reps, of pounds lifted\\n—in a given week. I am an immediate-gratification guy and I\\nwant to see results—and if I have to work out twice a day for a\\nweek to see those results, that works for me. BE CHARITABLE\\n\\nOne of the reasons I push so hard in my real estate business, in\\nmy consulting company, and on the books, audio programs,\\ncrazy motivation merchandise, and speaking is so I can use the\\nmoney to make a difference for the better. My friend Forbes\\n400 CEO Bob Duggan said to me, “Grant, giving money to\\n\\n\\n\\ncharity is an investment, not a contribution. ” This year I have\\ngiven almost 30 percent of my gross income to charities. Being charitable isn’t limited to giving money—it also\\nmeans giving your time, energy, intelligence, and inspiration. I\\nmake a point of speaking to high schools, colleges, churches\\nof any faith, and the military as much as possible. I recently\\nspoke to a church congregation about the importance of\\nfinancial literacy and solvency. As soon as I finish this chapter,\\nI will fly to Guatemala, at my own expense, to speak to that\\ncountry’s Department of Education about how to get\\nCardoneU to millions of people in Central America. Look for problems on this planet you can help with—and\\ngo help. I am super passionate about getting the truth out about\\ndrugs, not just street drugs but prescription drugs. So I use my\\ntime, energy, and platform to increase awareness about this\\nepidemic and work with great groups like the Citizens\\nCommission on Human Rights (CCHR) to raise awareness and\\ncombat it. Look for problems on this\\nplanet you can help with—\\nand go help. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nDO MORE THAN READ THIS BOOK\\n\\nYou can read this book—or any business book—and get\\nexcited for a moment. But being obsessed is not a small idea,\\nand you will meet resistance. This is not a weekend conference\\nwhere you walk across a fire, bend arrows, or break boards. This is obsession. You are being given permission,\\nprobably for the first time in your life, to go all in and be a\\nfreak. To sustain healthy, voluntary obsessions, to have it all\\nand do great things, requires more than a book. It requires\\n\\n\\n\\ntremendous commitment, clarity, confidence, sacrifice, and\\npersistence and a willingness to be in the minority, even\\nunpopular. No matter what’s going on in the outside world, with the\\nmedia, with politics, your obsession will have to continue to\\nfuel you long after the disappointments, and even long after\\nthe successes are yours. Day after day, week after week,\\nquarter after quarter, year after year your obsessions can\\ncontinue to fuel you. Use this book to undo the average thinking of those you\\nlive with, those you work with, and even your customers. Because after seriously resolving to be obsessed and clarifying\\nyour obsession, it is vital you get those around you to support\\nyou. Your partner might want the white picket fence, the\\ngolden retriever, and you home at 5:00 p. m. to watch weekend\\ntelevision marathons, and may talk constantly about simply\\nbeing happy. Getting your partner on the road to obsession is tough. It\\nrequires a plan and a sit-down talk with this person. This may\\nbe the biggest challenge of being obsessed, and you must\\nprepare for the sale of your life. Obsession isn’t just a mental game, either; it’s a total\\ngame involving the physical, spiritual, emotional, familial, and\\nfinancial. You have to be in great shape in every respect to\\nplay this game and stay in it, because the evil forces of\\naverage, entitlement, normalcy, and complacency are working\\nagainst you. Also, use this book to get those around you on the same\\npage with you. If you want to discover who is capable of being\\non the same page with you, have them read this book. Most\\nwon’t be able to get through it. But others will be woken up\\nand converted. Use the book as a filter to find out if people are up for\\nbeing part of your team and your life. Most will not take the\\nchallenge—this is not for everyone. But it is for me and I\\nexpect it is for you. Hit me up on your favorite social media platform with the\\nmessage “I am obsessed and refuse to have an average life. #BeObsessed,” and I will know you have read my book. On\\nTwitter, Facebook, Snapchat, YouTube, and LinkedIn I am\\n@GrantCardone (or just search for “Grant Cardone”). Come\\nand join the Obsessed movement. If you need anything at all, don’t hesitate to reach out to a\\nmember of my team. We’d love the privilege of coaching and\\nserving you, whether it’s using our training materials,\\ndelivering a live keynote to your organization, working with\\nyour kids’ school or college, speaking at your church, or\\ndelivering a virtual seminar to your people, and if I can answer\\nany of your questions, I’m here for you. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\n\\nI owe special thanks to several people who provided me the\\nlife material to create this book and to those who worked with\\nme to write and complete it. First, to my original family; my dad, who died when I was\\nten, taught me the value of a work ethic without ever saying\\nanything about it, and to my mom, who saved my life on\\nmultiple occasions, thank you for making it possible for me to\\never have a shot at the life I have today. To my wife, Elena, the prize of my life, who has never\\nsuggested I work too much or that my dreams are impossible\\nand who, on the other hand, pushes me to achieve even more. To my two beautiful girls, Sabrina and Scarlett, who would\\nrun around the house yelling, “Be obsessed or be average,\\nPapa, and finish the book!” I couldn’t have done it without\\nyou. To my most trusted confidant, Sheri Hamilton, my COO,\\nwho has my back and best interests at heart every day and who\\nhandles a control freak, me, better than anyone I’ve ever met. Thanks to all my staff in Miami who support me in all my last-\\nminute changes and spontaneity. I know much of the time it is\\nlike living through a category 5 hurricane that never ends. Deepest appreciation to my friend and philanthropist Bob\\nDuggan, who changed my life when he told me, “Make a\\ndifference for the better. ”\\n\\nTo Steve Carlis and Hank Norman at 2 Market Media,\\nwho have believed in me for the maniac I am and introduced\\nme to my new literary agent, Nena Madonia Oshman, who has\\nbeen awesome through the process. To the people at Penguin\\n\\n\\n\\nRandom House, my publisher, Adrian Zackheim, and\\nespecially my editor, Natalie Horbachevsky, who really got the\\nbook and loved the photo-shoot idea, allowing me to dance on\\nmy plane. Many thanks to the photographer, Rainer Hosch,\\nand Chris Sergio, the art director, who let me be me at the\\nphoto shoot and made for one of the funniest days of my life. And to my very, very special friends at my church who\\nhave dedicated their lives to making truth and freedom a\\nreality, I owe my gratitude to you all. When I was forty-five\\nyears of age, these were the first people to ever give me\\npermission to be Obsessed with My Obsessions: Gavin,\\nCharmaine, Vanessa, Josh, Sonya, Mandy, Tyler, Carol, Nancy,\\nBob, Ken, David, and Ron. And to all the naysayers and haters who have tried to stop\\nme, you have no idea how much you continue to supercharge\\nmy creativity, persistence, and dreams. To the many confused\\ncounselors and pathetic psychologists who tried pinning me\\nwith your made-up labels and evil prescription drugs, every\\ntime I encountered your peddling of confusion,\\nmisinformation, and walking-dead solutions you made my\\nchoices even clearer. Lastly, to my millions of extended online social media\\nfamily who follow my posts, articles, tweets, streams, videos,\\nand snaps, thank you for fueling my obsessions with your\\nenthusiasm and engagement, and still another level of\\ngratitude to those who pay me the ultimate compliment of\\nsharing my name and work with their friends and family. —\\nIf you or someone you love has been labeled or drugged or is\\naddicted to the wrong kind of obsessions, I recommend\\nchecking out one of the following resources.

Remember, when clarifying what you should be obsessed\\nwith, the following should be true:\\n\\n1. It improves the outcome of your life and others’ lives. 2. It moves you to reveal more of your potential. So what is your potential? That’s a powerful question to\\nkeep in front of you because it inspires more questions, like\\n“How much am I capable of?” “What do I need to fulfill my\\npotential?” and “What would it mean to me to fulfill my\\npotential?” Continuing to reach toward your full potential is\\nthe kind of fuel that will allow you to avoid getting lost,\\ncomplacent, and satisfied and dying prematurely. Some other\\ngreat questions to ask of yourself include:\\n\\nWho am I doing this for?\\nHow many will benefit from this?\\nWhat’s going to keep me fueled to do more?\\nWhat if anything were possible?\\nWhen I accomplish this, what is next?\\nWhat am I doing that is not purpose driven?\\nWhat else am I capable of doing that I haven’t done?\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat have I always wanted to do that I have forgotten\\nabout?\\nAre those around me on the same page?\\nWho is encouraging me to live a life of purpose?\\nWho is a good role model for what I am attempting?\\nWho around me is not living a life of purpose?\\nWhat can I do to help others achieve their purposes?\\n\\nI talked earlier about writing my goals down on a daily\\nbasis. In addition to that, at least once a month I sit down with\\na legal pad and pen to revisit my purposes and match them\\nagainst my revised potential. I often do this with my wife and\\ntop executives so we don’t become complacent with our\\nvictories and so we keep our attention on our possibilities. I can’t express this enough: Your purposes will continue to\\ngrow, mature, and evolve as you do. Regardless of how big\\nyour dreams are now, other possibilities within your potential\\nwill be revealed to you that will make previously out-of-reach\\ntargets look small. The moment you stop looking forward to\\naccomplish the next level is the moment you are at risk. I hope you’ll continue to be obsessed with always\\nuncovering more of your potential, even as you take your last\\nbreaths. OBSESSION HACKS\\n\\nI’ve shared with you my philosophy of obsession and made\\nthe case not only for why it’s been the factor that changed my\\nlife but also for how you can implement this mind-set and\\nthese practices in your own life. As we end, I want to share some ultimate final tips on how\\nto keep living and working toward your obsession. REACH UP FOR NEW FRIENDS\\n\\n\\n\\nNothing inspires me more than surrounding myself with\\npeople who have achieved more than I have and meeting new\\npeople. Whatever you have to do to make new friends and new\\nconnections, just make sure you are reaching up—not\\nsideways and not down. Don’t just be friends with a banker in\\nyour town—make sure you know the most successful banker\\nin your town, and the most successful lawyer, the most\\nsuccessful insurance guy, the most successful businessperson,\\nthe politically connected. And then keep reaching up. Know\\nthe woman who is called the most successful Realtor in your\\ncity or the guy your city newspaper calls “entrepreneur of the\\nyear. ” These are the people who must be in your network. Also, leave your home and join new clubs. Get involved\\nwith charities and give to them at levels that make others take\\nnotice. And attend events where power collects. I recently\\nwent to a J. P. Morgan conference in Miami. The net worth in\\nthe room was one quarter of a trillion dollars. I knew I was in\\nthe right room; just being there over lunch opened me up to\\nnew possibilities and fueled my obsessions. Attend events where power\\ncollects. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nIt is so easy to hang with the same people and justify it\\n(“They’re like family”), but it is vital to keep evolving. Also,\\nI’m sure I’m not the only one who gets bored with the same\\nold people and their same old stories (and I am sure they get\\nsick of hearing mine too). VACATION ABUNDANCE\\n\\nYou’ve read about my problem with the way most people take\\nvacations. So you might think I’m totally against any vacation\\ntime. Not so. If you’re going to go on vacation, overdose on it. Go for a\\nlong, spectacular trip, stay in the best hotels, fly first class (or\\nbetter yet, fly private), eat at the best restaurants, and treat\\nyourself like royalty, sparing no expense. If you can’t afford to\\ndo it first class and for an extended time, you aren’t ready to\\ngo. Because vacations are also an opportunity to grow\\nyourself, your business, and your network. You need to be in\\nplaces where other obsessed people gather. And sorry, but if\\nthe hotel you are booking offers free breakfast . that’s not\\nthe place you should be. You need to be in places\\nwhere other obsessed people\\ngather. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nElena and I recently rewarded ourselves with a trip,\\nwithout the kids, to Paris and Barcelona after a speaking tour\\nthrough Eastern Europe. We did it right—and put ourselves in\\nposition to not only enjoy ourselves but also make valuable\\nconnections. We stayed at the best places, ate at the best\\nrestaurants, and gave ourselves a chance to refuel, reboot, and\\noverdose on a vacation so we didn’t come home wanting\\nmore. MENTOR UP\\n\\nIt’s worth it to work with a coach or someone who can take\\nyou to another level. I have spent hundreds of thousands of\\ndollars a year buying someone’s time to help me get to another\\nlevel and push me to reach my full potential. At this time I\\nhave two coaches, one whose job is to get me connected with\\nother big players and another who is able to point out my blind\\nspots in my career and life. I need to surround myself with people I trust and respect\\nwho think large and who can help me get to where I want to\\ngo. You think you can run only so fast, but get a stopwatch out\\n\\n\\n\\nand get someone pulling for you (a cheerleader), and you will\\ndo more than you thought possible. It can’t hurt to have someone else pulling for you and\\nrooting for you and, yes, even pushing you. My mentors and\\ncoaches have been invaluable to me. SHOP OUTSIDE YOUR REACH\\n\\nI have been shopping for homes and toys outside my price\\nrange my entire life. Right now I am looking at a $40 million\\nhome in Coral Gables, a $280 million apartment deal in\\nMiami, and a new Gulfstream at $65 million—none of which I\\nwill buy (except maybe the apartment deals). At twenty-five I was living in a place that cost $275 a\\nmonth, and I was late on rent almost every month. Ever since\\nthen I have been shopping for luxury homes, cars, watches,\\nand amenities way outside my financial reach as a way to keep\\nmyself motivated. When I lived in Houston, I looked at homes\\nin River Oaks. When I lived in Los Angeles, I looked at homes\\nin Beverly Hills that were way beyond my reach. When we\\nmoved to Miami, I continued the same hack, looking at $200\\nmillion yachts, with no intention of ever buying, just allowing\\nmy mind to be blown and fueling my obsessions. Maybe it\\nseems like a silly, immature game, but it works for me. INVEST IN EDUCATION\\n\\nIf I have done one thing right to keep fueling my obsession, it\\nhas been continuing to invest in my own personal education\\nand development. When I was twenty-five, I invested $3,000 in learning\\nhow to become a sales professional. That decision was\\nresponsible for my first business. Today I spend almost 10\\npercent of my time and income on training programs,\\nconferences, coaches, books, and more. It might seem like a\\nlot to invest thirty-six days a year and 10 percent of my\\nincome in making myself better, but I think not; I am worth it. I refuse to be stupid. I refuse to not know. I refuse to make\\n\\n\\n\\nexcuses that I don’t have time or I am too busy. The best make\\ntime to ensure they continue to be the best. Regardless of how\\nwell I do in life or business, I know I can always learn more. Education has a totally\\ndifferent outcome when you\\nget to choose what you are\\nlearning. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nMost people don’t make time for more learning because\\ntheir previous educational experiences proved to be a waste of\\ntime. Education has a totally different outcome when you get\\nto choose what you are learning and know what you need to\\nlearn to improve yourself. And remember, time is no longer an\\nexcuse, because the obsessed make time, not excuses. PAYING ATTENTION TO PHYSICAL HEALTH\\n\\nAs important as it is to keep my mind sharp, I also believe that\\nI need to be in good physical shape and health in order to\\nachieve my potential. You can’t be obsessed if you are\\noverweight, you have no energy, and your body is aching\\nbecause you spend too much time in a chair.'}], 'max_tokens': 4096, 'temperature': 0, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}, 'output': {'id': 'chatcmpl-98KhQ5HGZiJ3ASTSvXnjr8jUSJUWD', 'model': 'gpt-4-0125-preview', 'usage': {'total_tokens': 4156, 'prompt_tokens': 3552, 'completion_tokens': 604}, 'object': 'chat.completion', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{\\n  \"summary\": \"The passage discusses the importance of being obsessed with one\\'s sense of purpose to achieve desires and potential.

Given a piece of text, chapterize and generate a JSON format as output. Follow the instructions below to help you in generating the output:\\n\\n1. **Understand the Key-Value Structure:**\\n   - A key-value pair consists of:\\n      - `\\'summary\\'`: A top-level overview or description of the chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'headers\\'`: A list of headers where a header is a line of text that introduces a new section or chapter in a document. It is typically formatted distinctly from the main body text to stand out, often being bolder, in a larger font, or differently styled. Headers are concise, summarizing the content that follows, and they guide the reader through the document\\'s structure. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'subheaders\\'`: A list of subheaders where subheaders are similar to headers but usually introduce subsections within a larger section. They are often formatted to be slightly less prominent than main headers, but still distinct from the body text. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'named_entities\\'`: A list of dictionary of named entities identified in the text. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'keypoints\\'`: A list of the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given text chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'tonality\\'`: The overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n\\n2. **Extract Relevant Information:**\\n   - Focus on extracting the most relevant information or identification from each chunk. This could include key themes, essential concepts, or significant details.\\n\\n3. **Perform Named Entity Recognition:**\\n   - Extract named entities from a given text and organize the results, providing the option for individual descriptions for each entity. \\n   - As part of the information extraction, identify and categorize any named entities, including but not limited to PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, etc., within the text.\\n   - The system should present the extracted entities in a structured format, allowing for detailed descriptions or additional information for each identified entity.  \\n   - Follow exactly the example below for the named entities:\\n\\n      named_entities = [\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_1>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_1>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1a>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_2>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1b>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with individual descriptions as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_2>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_3>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_4>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with a common description as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         # Add more entries as needed\\n      ]\\n   \\n   <Tag_1> and <Tag_2> represent different types of named entities.\\n   Each tag contains a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an entity and its associated description.\\n   Each entity can have an individual description.\\n\\n\\n4. **Determine the Tonality:**\\n   - Assess the overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Include this assessment under the key `\\'tonality\\'`.\\n\\n5. **Highlight the Keypoints:**\\n   - Identify and list the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given chunk under the key `\\'keypoints\\'`.\\n\\n6. **Header Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical to headers of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Look for any title case or all uppercase.\\n      - Position: Consider if any text is at the beginning of a section or stands alone.\\n      - Content: Assess if the text is concise and focused.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Note any numbering or special symbols.\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if any text introduces a new topic or section.\\n\\n7. **Subheader Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical of subheaders of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Subheaders often follow title case, but they might not always be in all uppercase, unlike some main headers.\\n      - Position: Check if the text appears within a section, usually following a main header. Subheaders are often used to introduce subtopics within a larger section.\\n      - Content: Determine if the text is more specific than a main header but still concise. It should elaborate on the content introduced by the main header.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Look for secondary or nested numbering or bullet points (e.g., \"1.1 Subsection\", \"• Subpoint\").\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if the text refines or narrows down the topic introduced by the main header, rather than introducing a completely new topic.\\n\\n8. **Generate Tags**\\n   - Please generate tags based on the given relevant information and strictly refrain from generating empty tags or empty array.\\n\\n9. **Provide Clear Details:**\\n   - Clearly present the information extracted from the piece of text.

Only I know that my\\n“overnight” success came after some 150,000 social media\\nposts, 78,000 tweets, 13,000 speaking engagements, 1,100\\narticles, 700 interviews, thousands of live streams, three\\nmillion flight miles, and who knows how many cold calls. Because all that cumulative trial and error led me to “explode”\\ninto success. Persist and one day you will\\nperfect. Then persist some\\nmore and you will find what\\nyou thought was perfect was\\na joke. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nBetter to fall facing forward than to never try at all\\nbecause you want your first attempt to be perfect (which won’t\\nhappen anyway). Persist and one day you will perfect. Then\\npersist some more and you will find what you thought was\\nperfect was a joke. Obsession is a cycle. THERE’S NO EXCUSE FOR NOT\\nPERSISTING\\n\\nDogged persistence in the face of setbacks, challenges,\\ncrybabies, quitters, disappointments, mistakes, distractions,\\ncrises, and petty bullshit is part of the game for everyone. Quit\\nfeeling sorry for yourself, quit complaining, and act like a\\nboss. Persistence is the characteristic of legends, greats, and\\ngeniuses who were called crazy because they didn’t quit when\\nthe average person would have. When you persist long after others quit, regardless of the\\noutcome, your power, confidence, creativity, and genius\\nautomatically light up. This happens because in the face of all\\nthese difficulties you learn how strong and resilient you are. This is essential. Every time you persist, you have another\\nstory to tell—a story of who you are: someone who is a little\\ncloser to their full potential. When you’re in the trenches,\\nremind yourself of how valuable and precious these stories\\nwill be in the future. In the movies no one wants to fight the guy who keeps\\ncoming back and can’t be killed. How much success you have\\nin the future may very well be determined by this one thing:\\nhow much you persist through the hard times. B\\n\\nCHAPTER 13\\n\\nOBSESSION FOREVER\\n\\nuying a jet was something I never even dreamed of\\nwhen I was young and broke, or even a few years\\nago. But after writing The 10X Rule, something\\n\\nchanged in me. I always write books to solve my own problems, and with\\nThe 10X Rule the problem I was trying to solve was figuring\\nout if my purpose was in line with my potential and if I was\\nreally doing everything in my power to be true to my\\nobsession. In doing that, I compared the almost endless list of\\nexpenses it took to run my businesses with what I needed to\\nachieve my purpose. I was flying all over North and South\\nAmerica, speaking and working. That costs both money and a\\nlot of time, and it took me away from my family when I\\nwanted to be with them. After thinking about it, I looked into buying a private\\nplane—which would give me greater control over my schedule\\nand, ultimately, how I could live out my obsession. My\\naccountant did the math and I did the math, and no matter how\\nmany times I went over it, the jet just did not pencil out. In my\\nresearch everyone told me the idea was ridiculous, except for\\ntwo people, who are both financially more successful than me\\nand who both own aircraft. One told me, “It’s the best\\ninvestment I ever made and I cannot make sense of it no\\nmatter how many times I run the numbers. ” The other one told\\nme, “It is the single best thing I have ever bought. ”\\n\\nIn the end I invested in a midsized jet—a Gulfstream\\nG200. I had “10X” painted on the tail and “365GC,” the\\n\\n\\n\\nregistration number, stenciled on both engines (a reminder to\\nbe myself 365 days a year). The first week I owned 10X\\nAirlines, I visited four customers in four different cities in the\\nsame day and was back with my family that night. Not one\\nperson in my space can get to a customer before I can. I don’t\\ncall a charter company and get booked into the schedule; I just\\ncall my pilots and off we go. As Elena reminded me, “It\\ndoesn’t need to make financial sense if it makes your life\\nmission possible. ” And it does. Whatever you have to do to keep your purpose burning\\nhot, do it. If it requires money, so be it. If you’re truly\\nobsessed, it will be worth it because you’ll get the results. The secret to sustaining the obsession is straightforward:\\nFocus your efforts on everything that will fuel you for the long\\nrun, and ignore, eliminate, or block out anything that drains\\nyou or causes you to doubt. Take responsibility for what you\\npay attention to—and remember that what and whom you pay\\nattention to is worth more than what you spend your dollars\\non. Money, power, fame, and success all follow attention, so\\nwhat gets the most attention is what will grow. The problem with these things—money, power, fame, and\\nsuccess—is they are like jealous lovers: They need constant\\nattention or they will leave you. They are all worth investing\\ntime into cultivating. But remember, time is the only truly\\nnonrenewable resource we have. How you invest your time is\\nmore important than how you invest your money. That is why refueling is a major hack for the successful. Sustain your efforts by knowing how to get re-energized, re-\\nexcited and jacked at ever higher levels, how to keep gunning\\nand running at full steam, all the time, and what to do when\\nyou run out. ALWAYS RAISE AND REFUEL YOUR\\nOBSESSIONS\\n\\n\\n\\nFire needs wood, a car needs gas, a computer needs electricity,\\nand your obsessions need to be constantly fueled as well. The\\nultimate fuel to help you stay obsessed with your obsessions is\\nyour maturing and changing purposes throughout your life. Maybe you are just about the money at one point in your\\nlife. Well, good. Get that right. Or maybe you don’t care about\\nmoney and just want to help people. Then get that right. Maybe you want to do it for self-esteem or for respect in a\\ncommunity. Then accomplish that in a massive way. Or you\\ncould decide to feed them all and compromise nothing. Being\\nobsessed with your sense of purpose across all the parts of\\nyour life will allow you to accomplish all the things you desire\\nand become aware of those things maybe you couldn’t see\\nbefore.'}], 'max_tokens': 4096, 'temperature': 0, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}, 'output': {'id': 'chatcmpl-98Kh9BKjc0ELd15uz5PiG8RoGZaZK', 'model': 'gpt-4-0125-preview', 'usage': {'total_tokens': 4066, 'prompt_tokens': 3564, 'completion_tokens': 502}, 'object': 'chat.completion', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{\\n  \"summary\": \"The text emphasizes the importance of persistence over perfection, illustrating how continuous effort and embracing imperfections can lead to success.

Given a piece of text, chapterize and generate a JSON format as output. Follow the instructions below to help you in generating the output:\\n\\n1. **Understand the Key-Value Structure:**\\n   - A key-value pair consists of:\\n      - `\\'summary\\'`: A top-level overview or description of the chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'headers\\'`: A list of headers where a header is a line of text that introduces a new section or chapter in a document. It is typically formatted distinctly from the main body text to stand out, often being bolder, in a larger font, or differently styled. Headers are concise, summarizing the content that follows, and they guide the reader through the document\\'s structure. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'subheaders\\'`: A list of subheaders where subheaders are similar to headers but usually introduce subsections within a larger section. They are often formatted to be slightly less prominent than main headers, but still distinct from the body text. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'named_entities\\'`: A list of dictionary of named entities identified in the text. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'keypoints\\'`: A list of the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given text chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'tonality\\'`: The overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n\\n2. **Extract Relevant Information:**\\n   - Focus on extracting the most relevant information or identification from each chunk. This could include key themes, essential concepts, or significant details.\\n\\n3. **Perform Named Entity Recognition:**\\n   - Extract named entities from a given text and organize the results, providing the option for individual descriptions for each entity. \\n   - As part of the information extraction, identify and categorize any named entities, including but not limited to PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, etc., within the text.\\n   - The system should present the extracted entities in a structured format, allowing for detailed descriptions or additional information for each identified entity.  \\n   - Follow exactly the example below for the named entities:\\n\\n      named_entities = [\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_1>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_1>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1a>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_2>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1b>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with individual descriptions as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_2>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_3>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_4>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with a common description as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         # Add more entries as needed\\n      ]\\n   \\n   <Tag_1> and <Tag_2> represent different types of named entities.\\n   Each tag contains a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an entity and its associated description.\\n   Each entity can have an individual description.\\n\\n\\n4. **Determine the Tonality:**\\n   - Assess the overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Include this assessment under the key `\\'tonality\\'`.\\n\\n5. **Highlight the Keypoints:**\\n   - Identify and list the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given chunk under the key `\\'keypoints\\'`.\\n\\n6. **Header Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical to headers of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Look for any title case or all uppercase.\\n      - Position: Consider if any text is at the beginning of a section or stands alone.\\n      - Content: Assess if the text is concise and focused.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Note any numbering or special symbols.\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if any text introduces a new topic or section.\\n\\n7. **Subheader Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical of subheaders of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Subheaders often follow title case, but they might not always be in all uppercase, unlike some main headers.\\n      - Position: Check if the text appears within a section, usually following a main header. Subheaders are often used to introduce subtopics within a larger section.\\n      - Content: Determine if the text is more specific than a main header but still concise. It should elaborate on the content introduced by the main header.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Look for secondary or nested numbering or bullet points (e.g., \"1.1 Subsection\", \"• Subpoint\").\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if the text refines or narrows down the topic introduced by the main header, rather than introducing a completely new topic.\\n\\n8. **Generate Tags**\\n   - Please generate tags based on the given relevant information and strictly refrain from generating empty tags or empty array.\\n\\n9. **Provide Clear Details:**\\n   - Clearly present the information extracted from the piece of text. Ensure that the details are concise and informative.\\n\\n10. **Strict JSON Response:**\\n   - Strictly format your response as a JSON object.

Three weeks past most people’s breaking point, I was still\\nmaking hundreds of calls a day and visiting businesses in\\nperson, but no one was biting. No one around me had ever\\ndone what I was attempting. I had no role models to look up to\\n—no one to show me the way. The people who loved me were\\nencouraging me to quit. I hated losing 90 percent of the time. At my wits’ end, I seriously considered quitting—really\\nquitting—and returning to a job doing sales for someone else. The super successful don’t\\njust overcome their failures—\\nthey use them as fuel to\\npersist. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nWhat I held on to was all the stories of successful people\\nwho refused to quit. Disney, Oprah, Ford, and on and on. The\\nobsessed refuse to quit. The super successful don’t just\\novercome their failures—they use them as fuel to persist. I\\ntook inspiration from their ability to stick with their obsession\\nin the face of failure. J. K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, talked\\nabout the importance of failure for success when she spoke to\\nthe graduating class at Harvard in June 2008. “You might\\nnever fail on the scale I did,” Rowling told that privileged\\naudience. “But it is impossible to live without failing at\\nsomething, unless you live so cautiously that you might as\\nwell not have lived at all—in which case, you fail by default. ”\\n\\nThis is why it’s so important to be clear on your obsession\\nand why I have focused on that in this book. Your obsession\\nwill keep you going when you need bank loans from lenders\\n\\n\\n\\nwho initially said no, when you want to buy at prices that the\\nseller refuses to even counter, and even if you wish to marry\\nsomeone who will have nothing to do with you. Prospects will say no. Investors will laugh you out of the\\nroom. Banks will not even see you. Employees will quit,\\ndisappoint you, and maybe even steal from you. Your family\\nand friends will tell you that you are crazy. You may have to\\ngo into debt. You will have to put up with stuff that makes you\\nfeel like you are selling out. You’ll be underpaid, overworked,\\nexhausted, and you will think that giving up is your oasis. The difference between\\nsuccess and failure is staying\\nin the game when others\\nthrow in the towel. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nWell, it ain’t. The obsessed keep going. The difference between success and failure is staying in\\nthe game when others throw in the towel. Notice how many\\nprofessional ball teams win in the last minutes of the game. They never quit and even if they lose, they suit up, show up,\\nand play like champions. You need the drive to see something through, all the way,\\nno matter what. Don’t worry if you don’t have it now, because\\nit can be developed. Here are some ways to exercise your\\npersistence muscle:\\n\\nComplete every task, finish everything you start, and quit\\nwalking away from unfinished projects in your\\nprofessional and personal life. When you hit the wall, don’t focus on the obstacle. Look\\nfor creative ways to take another run at it. Expect others to quit; while persistence begins and ends\\nwith you, be prepared for people around you to quit and\\n\\n\\n\\ntry to persuade you to do the same. Use yesterday’s successes as fuel for persisting today. But\\ndon’t get stuck in them. Instead, stay interested in the next\\nsuccess and the one after that. Stay busy generating interest or income or learning\\nsomething—doing things that help you keep going—\\nbecause a rolling stone gathers no moss. Never settle, never be satisfied with your triumphs, and\\ninstead use them as fuel to move you further toward your\\nfull potential. When it comes to success, as my mom used to say, “Stick\\nand stay. It’s bound to pay. ” Hang in there no matter what. While there are probably a number of things in your life that\\nwould be convenient to quit on, your success is definitely not\\none of them. Stick and stay. It’s bound to\\npay. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nPERSIST UNTIL THE MIRACLE\\nHAPPENS\\n\\nMost people quit right before a miracle takes place. One day I was sitting at lunch by myself at a popular\\nhealthy restaurant (basically a place that served wheatgrass\\nand bean sprouts) in a hip part of Houston. I had just returned\\nfrom another city that had offered me nothing but failure. It\\nwas about one o’clock in the afternoon and I was taking a\\nbreak from the phone. I remember it like it was yesterday: I\\nwas tired, whipped, terrified, and out of juice. I was on the\\nverge of quitting for real, and that morning I had even told the\\ngirl I was dating, “I don’t know if I can do this anymore. ”\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile I sat at lunch in total defeat, I thought to myself, I\\njust need a sign. Something to tell me: Either quit or go on. And if I go on, where do I go next? I need a clear sign of what\\nto do. I don’t even know whom I was addressing. Was I praying?\\nBegging? Or just talking to myself? I still don’t know. I do\\nknow that I was in total doubt and at a very low point in my\\nlife. I was so lost that I was starting to look to horoscopes for\\ndirection and guidance that might determine my future. When\\nyou start depending on horoscopes, you know you are in\\ntrouble. After making my plea for a sign, I got in my car to go\\nhome. I started driving and saw that the license plate on the car\\nin front of me was from Salt Lake City. I had never been to\\nSalt Lake City, and I took this as a sign that I should go there\\nand promote my next seminar. I know this sounds crazy, but at\\nthe moment I felt it was the sign I had asked for. In that desperate state I was in, I just needed a tiny little\\npush to keep me in the game. Sure, it might sound woo-woo,\\nbut I was looking for anything to give me a cue about what to\\ndo next, where to go next—something to keep moving\\nforward, because forward movement is critical to staying\\nobsessed. I drove back to my little 125-square-foot office and I got\\non the phone and started calling businesses in Salt Lake City. I\\ndid that for the next three days. The calls were hard, as they\\nalways were, with the same types of responses: “Not\\ninterested,” “Don’t call me back again,” “Never heard of you. ”\\nThen, finally: “Sure, come by. If I have time, I will talk to\\nyou. ”\\n\\nThe same day I bought my plane ticket. The following\\nSunday I flew into Salt Lake City. Over the next few weeks\\nmy miracle happened, and I made more money in two weeks\\nthan I had made in the past two years. Something clicked; I\\nfigured things out, all of a sudden, in a way that forever\\nchanged my life, my career, and my future. That trip made it\\n\\n\\n\\npossible for me to not just pay my bills but fund the rest of my\\ncareer, live my purpose to help people, and become a star in\\nthe sales arena. I had refused to quit, and that was a good call because my\\nmiracle was just around the corner. If you refuse to quit, I\\ndon’t care what you are trying to create, you will not fail. It is\\njust a matter of time before you figure it out. While I had not\\nbeen successful up until that point, I was learning what did not\\nwork, so I knew what not to do until I knew just what to do. From then on, I was rocking. Was the license plate a miraculous sign? Of course not!\\nIt’s just that I didn’t quit when I thought I wanted to. I gave it\\none more try—and my best try at that. This is your “miracle moment. ” This moment when you\\nthink you have gone beyond every limit you have and then you\\ngo beyond them one more time. When you do that, everything\\nturns around. Those who are truly obsessed are willing to persist when it\\nno longer makes sense. Become obsessed with developing\\npersistence as one of your power weapons and one of your\\ngreat assets. Because your movement forward during the\\nhardest, most soul-crushing times, the times that are filled with\\nimpossibilities, guarantees your success. When all the average\\npeople would never continue, put one foot in front of the other\\nand refuse to back down, knowing that when you quit you just\\nhave to start over again. Those who are truly\\nobsessed are willing to\\npersist when it no longer\\nmakes sense. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\n\\n\\nGET IT DONE, THEN GET IT RIGHT\\n\\n“Perfectionism” is nothing but a fancy word for not getting\\nstarted and not persisting.

Subheaders are often used to introduce subtopics within a larger section.\\n      - Content: Determine if the text is more specific than a main header but still concise. It should elaborate on the content introduced by the main header.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Look for secondary or nested numbering or bullet points (e.g., \"1.1 Subsection\", \"• Subpoint\").\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if the text refines or narrows down the topic introduced by the main header, rather than introducing a completely new topic.\\n\\n8. **Generate Tags**\\n   - Please generate tags based on the given relevant information and strictly refrain from generating empty tags or empty array.\\n\\n9. **Provide Clear Details:**\\n   - Clearly present the information extracted from the piece of text.

Society complains\\nabout the control freak when the problem is the millions of\\nmanagers, executives, business owners, politicians, and\\nparents who refuse to be in control. Managers have to check\\nwith their people to see if they will “buy in” before instituting\\nan initiative for the company. Sad. Trust me, if you come across people who struggle with the\\nidea I am sharing here, you don’t want to hire them—and if\\nyou already have, get them out of your life. Those who resist\\ncontrol are those who have something to hide. Those who\\nresist or speak badly about control or even micromanaging are\\nlow performers and are surrounded by people operating below\\ntheir potential. So many people don’t think enough of themselves to\\nbelieve they can control their environment, their kids, their\\nfinances, their time, or their results. It’s an epidemic maybe\\nborn out of all that psychoanalyzing that was so popular over\\nthe last twenty years. Well, that’s not ever going to be me, because I am\\nobsessed with avoiding the problems that come with losing\\ncontrol in the most important parts of my life. If that means\\nyou call me a control freak, bring it on. From ensuring my\\nfamily’s personal safety to looking after my finances, I want\\ncontrol!\\n\\nDON’T WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO\\nGIVE YOU CONTROL\\n\\nYou don’t have to be given responsibility or promoted to a\\nleadership position to exert control. I have never been “given”\\ncontrol—I have just taken it. I exerted control because I\\ntrusted myself to get the job done. It wasn’t a matter of\\nanyone’s giving me permission. You don’t have to be given\\nresponsibility or promoted to\\na leadership position to exert\\ncontrol. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nIf you see an obvious problem and you’ve got a solution,\\nit’s your responsibility to exert control, to step up and lead. Declare: “I got this!” As the old saying goes, it’s easier to ask\\nfor forgiveness than permission. In the cutthroat world we live\\nin today, you can’t wait for the authorities to provide for your\\nfuture. If your boss isn’t around and a high-level client needs\\nservicing, are you going to tell them that he’ll call them back,\\nor are you going to provide the service? So what if you make\\n\\n\\n\\nthe wrong decision? Make a decision, be dangerous, and if\\nyour boss doesn’t like it, come work for me!\\n\\nI believe I know best in everything I do, and if I don’t, I\\nget trained until I have complete confidence and competence\\nin whatever I am doing. Whether it’s making a sales call,\\nhandling my four-year-old, or operating a firearm, I want\\ncontrol over all my various skill sets so that I can lead in all\\nthe different areas of my life. I don’t need to be the smartest\\nperson in the room—I don’t even need to be right—but I do\\nneed to be willing to control things. I don’t need to be the\\nsmartest person in the room\\n—I don’t even need to be\\nright—but I do need to\\ncontrol. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nI have a real problem with people who equate intelligence\\nwith leadership and control. It’s not about just being smart or\\neven being right. If someone is right but doesn’t have control,\\nthey will ultimately be unable to prove themselves right . and will therefore be wrong!\\n\\nI own five companies. I don’t manage those businesses; I\\ncontrol them. I hire managers. I hire department heads. I write\\nthe checks, I take risks, I make decisions, and I put myself and\\nmy business into dangerous situations in hopes of a payoff. I\\nam a boss, an entrepreneur, so while I need managers to make\\nsure we get things done, I control the environment to get what\\nI want. And I give up control to others only when they have\\nproven the environment is more successful under their control. CONTROL THE PROCESS,\\nCONTROL THE RESULTS\\n\\n\\n\\nThe control freak is like an IRS auditor—a stickler obsessed\\nwith seeing results. You can demand results and demand to see\\nthose results at any moment of any day. Show me the numbers,\\nshow me our successes, show me the money, show me where\\nyou put the money, show me what customers said, show me\\nthe statements, show me how you closed the customer. Listen\\nto the calls. We record all the calls in our sales department so I can\\nreview them later if I need to. Even better, sometimes I listen\\nlive during the call without anyone’s knowing I am on the call. Better yet is interjecting myself into the call and taking it over\\nin real time to save the close. I want to see things for myself—what is happening, how\\nit’s happening. I want to always be feeling the pulse of what is\\ngoing on. Can’t I trust my people? Aren’t they capable of\\nholding themselves accountable? Didn’t I hire the right\\nemployees? Aren’t the right systems in place? I refuse to\\nassume anything, because anyone who does will be sorry later. What’s the old saying? To assume makes an ass out of you and\\nme. No thanks.

This is happening in the face of all the\\ngreat stories we have about the importance of persistence,\\n\\none of the great characteristics of success. Here are some examples of people who persisted longer\\nthan anyone thought reasonable:\\n\\nWalt Disney was turned down for financing 302 times. His first animation company went bankrupt. Stephen King’s first book, Carrie, was rejected thirty\\ntimes. He even threw the manuscript in the trash. Oprah Winfrey was told she was unfit for television. Fred Astaire was told during his first screen test, “Can’t\\nact. Can’t sing. Slightly bald. ”\\nLady Gaga’s first record deal was dropped after just one\\nmonth. Howard Schultz’s employer had no interest in his coffee\\nidea and sold him the brand name “Starbucks. ”\\nSteven Spielberg was rejected from film school three\\ntimes. Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard and his first company,\\nTraf-O-Data, went nowhere. Henry Ford’s first two car companies failed and left him\\nbroke. Mark Cuban failed as a carpenter, a waiter, and a cook. When people quit, others comfort them with condolences:\\n“You tried. ” “It’s all right, it just didn’t work out. ” “Why don’t\\nyou find something easy, where people don’t mistreat you and\\nvalue your service?” “Just be happy with what you have. ”\\nPeople will give you permission to quit. You don’t need to be comforted when things don’t turn out\\nright. Sympathy is not what you need. Comfort doesn’t pay the\\nbills. Because, as I’ve emphasized in other chapters, you are at\\nyour best when you’re outside your comfort zone, pushing\\nyourself and pushing limits to make the impossible possible. ONLY QUITTING IS FAILURE\\n\\nWhen I started my first business, I was out pitching a new idea\\nthat I was super jacked about—a proprietary sales training\\nprogram called “Information Assisted Selling. ” I just knew\\neveryone was going to listen to me and want to buy my\\nproduct. I had put together a business plan and figured that if\\njust 10 percent of the people I pitched to bought from me, I\\nwould have a great business. I knew the idea was solid, the\\ntechnology was effective, the market needed something new,\\nand I had a good track record. My potential market was huge:\\nAlmost 28 million businesses in America depend on sales. After all, I thought, who doesn’t want to increase sales?\\n\\nWithin twenty-four hours of setting up shop, I was ready\\nto quit. For the next two years I wanted to quit every day. I\\nwas making cold phone calls and so many people would hang\\nup on me, curse me out, tell me to never call them again. Once\\nin a while someone would say, “Sure, come on by. ” Then I\\nwould get on a plane, fly to their city, and present my product. I’d also use the rest of my time in that city to follow up on\\nsome more cold calls by showing up at the same companies\\nthat had said they weren’t interested. I was trying to sell successful businesses and established\\nmillionaires on how to make even more money and teach their\\n\\n\\n\\nsalespeople how to make even more sales. I thought it would\\nbe easy. It wasn’t! I wasn’t pulling in enough money to pay the\\nbills and was going through cash fast.

The only people\\nwho don’t like control are those who don’t have it or who have\\nmisused it in the past. ”\\n\\nThe only people who don’t\\nlike control are those who\\ndon’t have control or who\\nmisused it in the past. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nAll of my role models growing up were outgoing,\\naggressive, charismatic, and willing to exert control. I was\\nattracted to the idea that the person who was in control had the\\npower, called the shots, and made the decisions. Who doesn’t love and admire the person in control, the\\nsuperhero who puts himself at risk in order to solve problems,\\nprotect people, and save the world? James Bond, for example,\\nhas all the great equipment, slick suits, and hot women. He is\\nalso always in charge, willing to disregard authority to do the\\nright thing, and more dangerous than the bad guys. I couldn’t wait to grow up and be in charge. My dad was a\\ncontrol artist; he wielded his control like a hammer and didn’t\\n\\n\\n\\nput up with any nonsense, at least at home. This made our\\nenvironment safe; we knew who was in control and who was\\nthe leader. He knew where he was going and what he expected\\nfrom himself and others, had an unbelievable work ethic,\\nloved people, and believed being successful was his duty. He\\ncommanded respect and demanded discipline from his kids. And my older brother, Curtis, adopted a lot of that swag. He\\nwas strong, fast, super articulate, confident, and one of the\\nmost natural politicians I’ve ever met. I idolized him. I have no idea if either saw himself as a “leader. ” But they\\ndefinitely influenced people’s behavior, even if they didn’t\\nhave a formal title. CONTROL VERSUS LEADERSHIP\\n\\nI am constantly asked about my leadership style. I don’t really\\nthink about leadership; I think about control. I know “leader”\\nsounds more inspiring and that the business world wants to\\ntalk about leadership—but when thing go wrong, I don’t care\\nabout leadership; I want control, or at least to know someone\\nis in control. I want answers, I want to solve problems quickly,\\nand know I have the ability to deliver solutions and get the\\nscene back under control. Am I a leader? In my own organization, with finances,\\nwith my family, church, and community, yes, I am a leader. In\\nbusiness, social media, and the sales arenas I am a leader. But\\nwhen I go to work for another company or support the military\\nat the Pentagon, I am not the leader in that situation. I am\\nworking with others who are leading—but I still want control. Maybe I am splitting hairs here, but I don’t care about the\\ntitle; I just care about whether I have the power to determine,\\npredict, and influence outcomes. If you look around, you’ll see\\nthat we have a lot of people calling themselves leaders who\\ndon’t have any control. I don’t care about the title; I\\njust care about whether I\\nhave the power to determine,\\npredict, and influence\\noutcomes. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nI played baseball when I was younger, as a catcher. And as\\ncatcher it was my job not just to catch the pitch but to guide\\nthe team from behind the plate. While I wasn’t the best athlete\\non the team, I knew how to get others excited and focused\\nbecause I was able to exert control. I was willing to use my\\nvoice, my energy, and my confidence to build up the\\nconviction of others. It is my belief that all true leaders are willing to take\\ncontrol. It takes guts to stand up and exert control over their\\nenvironments, their people, and their futures. It’s a good thing. The willingness to exert control takes courage and\\nconfidence. It’s amazing what you can accomplish once you\\nclear up any negative connotations you have about control,\\nmake a decision to exert control, and then get used to using\\ncontrol to improve conditions for those around you. This third\\npoint is especially key. By pushing people to levels they never\\nthought they could achieve, you will do something for them\\nthat their parents, teachers, siblings, and peers did not. You\\nwill show them how to make the most of their life and pass on\\nto them your gift of obsession. If you haven’t been called a control freak at some point in\\nyour life, then you have a problem. Those who don’t like\\ncontrol are the ones with the problem. Those who don’t like control\\nare the ones with the\\nproblem. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s time to fall in love with control and learn how to use it\\nto improve your surroundings and make your dreams a reality. Be willing to be a control freak. The haters and naysayers are\\ngoing to hate it, but we’ve already covered their motivations. ONLY AVERAGE PEOPLE REFUSE\\nTO ASSUME CONTROL\\n\\nControl is a good thing. Just because others try to make it bad\\ndoesn’t mean it is. The fact is, out-of-control people have\\ngiven control a bad name. Remember, what others criticize are\\nthe very things they have given up on. The people who complain about control are the same\\npeople who refuse to exert control over their environment and\\nthen resent their environment. People who have misused\\ncontrol in the past refuse to take control because they don’t\\ntrust themselves to use it for the good of others. Those without control have refused to lead and refused to\\nbe responsible for controlling their environments. If you refuse to control, someone else will. Media, your\\nspouse, the neighbors, politicians, Twitter, Facebook, big\\npharma, and on and on all make huge efforts every second of\\nevery day to control anyone who will pay attention. Every day you and I are given an opportunity to grab the\\nreins and ride the beast, to control our own environment. I\\nwake up and try to beat the sun up every day because I want\\ncontrol. I get to the gym because I know control is important. I\\nexceed targets and deadlines because I demand control. I fire\\nsomeone who is late more than twice because I know I have a\\nbetter chance of success when I am in control of the office\\nculture and work ethic. I make tough decisions because I\\nexercise my control. So many defer opportunities to be in control by saying\\n“No thanks” or “Let me think about it. ” They’d prefer to sit in\\n\\n\\n\\nthe backseat and tell you, when it’s too late, that you missed\\nthe turn. Or worse, they sit at your side and try to navigate\\nyour direction, adding what-ifs and doubts but never being\\nwilling to take a stand. Most managers don’t want to be the boss. Hell, most\\nbosses don’t even want to be the boss. Bosses and managers\\nwho have an all-in obsession with success, who will do\\nwhatever it takes to see things through—even if I die—are\\ndifficult to find. The norm is that people are satisfied with\\nhaving “VP” put on their card—and then turn down true\\nresponsibility because they refuse to exercise control.'}], 'max_tokens': 4096, 'temperature': 0, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}, 'output': {'id': 'chatcmpl-98Kg3bBduhkmxryCS6wUJD3jewjjx', 'model': 'gpt-4-0125-preview', 'usage': {'total_tokens': 4073, 'prompt_tokens': 3552, 'completion_tokens': 521}, 'object': 'chat.completion', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{\\n  \"summary\": \"The passage discusses the importance of control and leadership within a professional setting, emphasizing the need for a strong, positive culture and the role of the leader in maintaining control and inspiring the team.

I’ve been let down so many times—so, so\\nmany times—by people I’ve hired, including:\\n\\nI have to recruit constantly\\njust to keep finding people\\nwho might fit in with my\\ncompanies, and I have to\\nkeep recruiting so I can get\\nrid of people I am not happy\\nwith. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nthe “perfect” hire who proved to be otherwise;\\nthe hire who I just knew in my heart was wrong, but I\\ngave them a shot anyway;\\nthe good one with the great résumé and pedigree who\\nfell flat on their face;\\nthe liar;\\nthe criminal;\\nthe vanilla, honest guy who didn’t steal anything but\\nwho never gave me everything either;\\nthe “detail-oriented” one who spent time on the details\\nonly because they didn’t actually know what they were\\ndoing;\\n\\n\\n\\nthe one who thought they knew everything but really\\nknew nothing about what the organization needed. Every time we let someone go, I consider that a good\\nthing. It means we are not settling and won’t be held hostage\\nby average. We are taking action to get rid of those who don’t\\nfit. I know companies that brag about having the same people\\nwork there for twenty years. But are they really productive or\\njust hanging around? Think about pro sports. NFL and NBA\\nteams don’t hire like that. They say, “Produce or we’re trading\\nyou to someone else. ” They are constantly recruiting and\\nmaking room for new players. You should too. I know companies that brag\\nabout low turnover, but it\\ntakes courage to get rid of\\npeople who no longer belong. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nCompanies that never fire anyone, that do everything\\npossible to have no turnover, are holding themselves back. I\\ndon’t like it when people quit my company because it means\\nwe didn’t get rid of them first. It means that the company is\\nplaying defense, not offense. Let’s say you have someone working for you who has\\nbeen secretly thinking about leaving the company. Do you\\nthink he actually quits the day he first thinks about leaving?\\nHell, no. While he decides to leave in March, he doesn’t quit\\nuntil December. In the nine months before he finally has the\\ncourage to walk out, he pumps his doubts into your\\norganization. Through his very presence or lack of total\\npresence, he brings doubt into the group. It affects not only his\\nproduction but also everyone around him. I expect to lose people when I hire them. I tell my wife,\\n“People come and go. You should assume that the only people\\nwho will be left in this business at the end are us. ” That’s okay. Don’t let this get you down. Hire, hire more, and hire again. You will not wreck your business by losing people; you\\nwill wreck it when you quit recruiting. You deserve to grow\\nyour business and make it a household name, and you can’t do\\nso without others helping you get the word out. You need\\npeople who will run through walls for you, themselves, and\\ntheir families to grow your business and their income, people\\nwho will die for the cause. That does not mean you can expect\\neveryone to do so. You need to be obsessed with finding\\nunbelievable people, and you need to borrow, spend, and even\\nsteal from other businesses to get them. Then do whatever is\\nnecessary to get them to buy into your culture, get rid of those\\nwho don’t, and repeat. You need to be obsessed\\nwith finding unbelievable\\npeople, and you need to\\nborrow, spend, and even\\nsteal from other businesses\\nto get them. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nREWARD PERFORMANCE\\n\\nI have a policy that is announced to every person when they\\nare hired: “You will never be given a raise because of how\\nlong you work here. If you want a raise or a bonus, earn it!\\nThe responsibility to earn more money is on you, just as it is\\non me. ”\\n\\nI don’t give employees bonuses just because they have\\nbeen at the job for a year or because it’s Christmas. Years ago\\n\\n\\n\\nan employee came to me and said, “I have been here twelve\\nmonths. I think it’s time for a raise. ” I said to her, “I was\\nhoping that after twelve months, you would be doing more for\\nthe company than just the job we hired you to do. You want\\nmore money? Get me more money. Don’t just do your job— I\\nalready pay you fairly for that. ”\\n\\nI don’t hire people to just do their jobs; I hire people to\\nhelp me grow my company. If you want a raise, increase the\\nincome of your department or reduce the cost of the operation\\nof that department. It’s that easy. I don’t hire people to just do\\ntheir jobs; I hire people to\\nhelp me grow my company. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nProduce more than what we pay you to do and you can\\nearn a bonus. I will not give you a bonus for being loyal, a\\ngood communicator, a team player, organized, and punctual or\\nbecause you’ve been at the job a long time. I expect all those\\nqualities and have paid for that already. And furthermore I will\\nfire you if you can’t deliver those expected qualities. People\\nare being set up for failure in life when they are given raises\\nfor the wrong things. I pay a bonus when you get the company a bonus, the\\nsame way the world pays me. And it’s not any different for\\nother departments. The top executives in my businesses get\\nfair salaries (not high) and are then rewarded based on the\\ncombined bottom line of all departments, paid quarterly. Managers of departments are paid bonuses each month on net\\nincome for hitting targets in excess of the cost of running their\\ndepartments and what I could achieve without their efforts. I pay a bonus when you get\\nthe company a bonus, the\\n\\n\\n\\nsame way the world pays me. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nI do this for all people across all departments, including\\nthose departments that would otherwise be completely\\ndisconnected from revenue creation. For instance, the\\ntechnology department is filled with people who have never\\nearned commissions. I have completely changed how they see\\ntheir department and earn money. They are now more\\ninterested in net income for that department than in gigabytes\\nand coding. Now rather than slowly doing their tech functions,\\nthey are motivated to use technology to produce income. DON’T JUST HIRE—BUILD A\\nCULTURE\\n\\nHiring and finding quality, hungry people is just stage one of\\nthe challenge. You have to then create the company culture\\nyou want. What is the culture you have created? What do you want\\nyour company to look, act, and sound like? Does it look, act,\\nand sound like that? And do the people you hire know what\\nthat culture is? Personally, I want my business, my house, my\\ncar, and what I own to be extensions of me and my ideas, not\\nextensions of someone else’s. Here are some examples from\\nthe company culture I create and work to maintain:\\n\\nI demand order and expect that from others. I work hard and I expect that from others. I work fast and I expect that from others. I take time to invest in myself to become more\\ncompetent and confident, and I expect that from others. I dress a certain way at work and I expect others to also\\ndress for success. I can’t make others do these things—but they can’t make\\nme keep them around either. I spent too much of life being\\nreasonable, not knowing I get to have things the way I want. Come to our offices sometime and you will see an extension of\\nme. I am constantly reinforcing the culture I want. I fought\\nhard for my success, and I know I have to fight to keep it,\\nstarting with the culture. One day in our offices I saw a sales guy taking notes on a\\nsticky pad. I went over to him and asked, “What is that\\ncustomer worth that you were just talking to?” He told me he\\nthought the account was worth $80,000. “Then why have you\\nreduced an $80,000 customer to a sticky note?” I said. “I’m\\nnot short on paper or technology. ” I went to my office and\\noutlawed the use of sticky notes in the sales department. I’m\\nenforcing the culture I want to create. Similarly, I had a guy walk into my office for a job\\ninterview wearing cologne. I said to him, “If you get the job\\nhere, don’t ever come into my office wearing cologne again. ” I\\ndon’t like cologne—and it’s my company so my way goes. By\\nthe same token, if you smoke cigarettes, use drugs, drink, have\\nmarital problems, have money problems, and live in drama,\\nyou can do it on your time, not mine. Don’t bring it to my\\noffice. We live in a world today where business owners feel bad\\nabout getting what they want in their own company. It’s crazy!\\nI am doing whatever it takes to get what I want, even if it takes\\ntelling someone the hard truth. I attempt to dominate the thinking of my employees every\\nday. My people spend eight hours a day with me and then are\\ninfluenced by their surroundings for the other sixteen hours.'}], 'max_tokens': 4096, 'temperature': 0, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}, 'output': {'id': 'chatcmpl-98KfjuIAR7VFLHKAJp2LqkvZmSlCd', 'model': 'gpt-4-0125-preview', 'usage': {'total_tokens': 3924, 'prompt_tokens': 3551, 'completion_tokens': 373}, 'object': 'chat.completion', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{\\n  \"summary\": \"The passage discusses the challenges and strategies of hiring and managing employees, emphasizing the importance of not settling for average performance and the necessity of constantly recruiting to find and retain exceptional talent.

Given a piece of text, chapterize and generate a JSON format as output. Follow the instructions below to help you in generating the output:\\n\\n1. **Understand the Key-Value Structure:**\\n   - A key-value pair consists of:\\n      - `\\'summary\\'`: A top-level overview or description of the chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'headers\\'`: A list of headers where a header is a line of text that introduces a new section or chapter in a document. It is typically formatted distinctly from the main body text to stand out, often being bolder, in a larger font, or differently styled. Headers are concise, summarizing the content that follows, and they guide the reader through the document\\'s structure. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'subheaders\\'`: A list of subheaders where subheaders are similar to headers but usually introduce subsections within a larger section. They are often formatted to be slightly less prominent than main headers, but still distinct from the body text. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'named_entities\\'`: A list of dictionary of named entities identified in the text. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'keypoints\\'`: A list of the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given text chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'tonality\\'`: The overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n\\n2. **Extract Relevant Information:**\\n   - Focus on extracting the most relevant information or identification from each chunk. This could include key themes, essential concepts, or significant details.\\n\\n3. **Perform Named Entity Recognition:**\\n   - Extract named entities from a given text and organize the results, providing the option for individual descriptions for each entity. \\n   - As part of the information extraction, identify and categorize any named entities, including but not limited to PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, etc., within the text.\\n   - The system should present the extracted entities in a structured format, allowing for detailed descriptions or additional information for each identified entity.  \\n   - Follow exactly the example below for the named entities:\\n\\n      named_entities = [\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_1>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_1>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1a>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_2>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1b>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with individual descriptions as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_2>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_3>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_4>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with a common description as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         # Add more entries as needed\\n      ]\\n   \\n   <Tag_1> and <Tag_2> represent different types of named entities.\\n   Each tag contains a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an entity and its associated description.\\n   Each entity can have an individual description.\\n\\n\\n4. **Determine the Tonality:**\\n   - Assess the overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Include this assessment under the key `\\'tonality\\'`.\\n\\n5. **Highlight the Keypoints:**\\n   - Identify and list the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given chunk under the key `\\'keypoints\\'`.\\n\\n6. **Header Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical to headers of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Look for any title case or all uppercase.\\n      - Position: Consider if any text is at the beginning of a section or stands alone.\\n      - Content: Assess if the text is concise and focused.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Note any numbering or special symbols.\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if any text introduces a new topic or section.\\n\\n7. **Subheader Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical of subheaders of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Subheaders often follow title case, but they might not always be in all uppercase, unlike some main headers.\\n      - Position: Check if the text appears within a section, usually following a main header. Subheaders are often used to introduce subtopics within a larger section.\\n      - Content: Determine if the text is more specific than a main header but still concise. It should elaborate on the content introduced by the main header.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Look for secondary or nested numbering or bullet points (e.g., \"1.1 Subsection\", \"• Subpoint\").\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if the text refines or narrows down the topic introduced by the main header, rather than introducing a completely new topic.\\n\\n8. **Generate Tags**\\n   - Please generate tags based on the given relevant information and strictly refrain from generating empty tags or empty array.\\n\\n9. **Provide Clear Details:**\\n   - Clearly present the information extracted from the piece of text.

The entrepreneurial\\nemployee will always focus\\non the opportunity, not just\\nthe money. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nTruly talented people know the opportunity is always\\nmore important than “How much?” The entrepreneurial\\nemployee will always focus on the chance, not just the money. Take my graphics guy, Paul. When we met, he said, “I want to\\nwork with you because I know you are going places. Don’t\\npay me anything; let me just prove myself. ” I hired him on the\\nspot. Paul has turned out to be an almost perfect hire for my\\ncompany. He recognized there was opportunity and believed in\\nhis own skills enough to not worry about the money in the\\nshort term, knowing he could show value in the long term and\\nwould be rewarded. Last year Paul made over six figures\\nworking at a job that would typically pay $65,000. Ask yourself: Is the person in front of you focused on the\\nicing or the cake? People who are into immediate gratification,\\npromises of advancement, and bonuses based on tenure and\\nare more concerned about time off than about how they can\\ncontribute just don’t work out in my companies. I’m looking\\nfor people who don’t merely want to do their job but want to\\n\\n\\n\\nhelp me make more money, help with my company’s\\nexpansion, knowing they will benefit. Your job is not to take care of\\nother people’s confusion;\\nyour job is to keep the\\nconfused out of your\\norganization. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nThe morals the person in front of you practices in their\\npersonal life are the same ones they’ll bring to work. Yes, you\\nare hiring from a planet of broken people with good intentions,\\nmost of whom are not fit to work for the obsessed. Don’t feel\\nbad about it. Your job is not to take care of other people’s\\nconfusion. Your job is to keep the confused out of your\\norganization. HIRE SURPRISING PEOPLE\\n\\nDon’t be afraid to look outside the usual channels for new\\nhires. Great people might have really surprising backgrounds. We hired a graphics pro who did not yet have his\\nAmerican citizenship when he replied to our craigslist ad. He\\nhas been with me for three years and is like family. He never\\nmisses work, is always on time, and does an unbelievable job. (He also just became an American citizen. )\\n\\nWe posted another ad online for a “personal video\\ngenius. ” The guy I ended up hiring was working at Banana\\nRepublic when he saw the ad—not exactly where I thought I’d\\nbe hiring from. He’s been with me for almost three years,\\ntravels with me around the world, and is one of our top income\\nearners. CHASE THE TALENT—AND PERSIST TILL THEY’RE YOURS\\n\\nBefore she worked for me, my chief operating officer worked\\nfor a major celebrity in Los Angeles. I had heard about her and\\n\\n\\n\\ntried to hire her for more than two years before I finally got\\nher. She now helps me oversee Cardone Acquisitions, Cardone\\nTraining Technologies, and Grant Cardone TV. A NOTE ON STAFFING AGENCIES\\n\\nWe have used ten different hiring agencies—in an effort to\\nsave time—and they have all been total disappointments. They\\nsend people who don’t even have enough confidence to shake\\nmy hand and maintain eye contact. While I confess that I do\\nuse them, I don’t like them. My COO might default to them,\\nbut if I know someone came through a hiring agency, I almost\\nknow for sure they won’t work. That’s because no one knows\\nyour business or brand like you do. No staffing agency can\\nmake the pitch to work for my companies—or figure out who\\nwill really fit in—as well as I can. ROLL WITH TURNOVER\\n\\nI know everyone hates turnover, and there is so much data\\nsuggesting high employee turnover is a terrible statistic. A 2012 Forbes study found that the average employee\\nstayed on the job 4. 4 years. A PayScale report found the median tenure for a\\nmillennial employee was just two years, compared with\\nseven years for a baby boomer. A 2013 survey by Millennial Branding and Beyond. com,\\na career networking site, found 30 percent of companies\\nhad lost 15 percent or more of their millennial workers\\nwithin the previous year. A 2014 study by CompData Surveys suggests that your\\nturnover rate is going to be one keeper for every seven\\nhires. Those are depressing statistics—but they don’t tell the full\\nstory. It might surprise you, but it means almost nothing to me\\nthat we turn over people. I understand the reality. I am a hard\\nguy to work for not because I am tough or unfair but because\\nworking with me is many people’s first experience working\\nwith someone who really pushes them. I have to recruit\\nconstantly just to keep finding people who might fit in with\\nmy companies. Maybe more important, I have to keep\\nrecruiting so I can get rid of people I am not happy with. Most new hires will not be great hires.

Given a piece of text, chapterize and generate a JSON format as output. Follow the instructions below to help you in generating the output:\\n\\n1. **Understand the Key-Value Structure:**\\n   - A key-value pair consists of:\\n      - `\\'summary\\'`: A top-level overview or description of the chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'headers\\'`: A list of headers where a header is a line of text that introduces a new section or chapter in a document. It is typically formatted distinctly from the main body text to stand out, often being bolder, in a larger font, or differently styled. Headers are concise, summarizing the content that follows, and they guide the reader through the document\\'s structure. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'subheaders\\'`: A list of subheaders where subheaders are similar to headers but usually introduce subsections within a larger section. They are often formatted to be slightly less prominent than main headers, but still distinct from the body text. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'named_entities\\'`: A list of dictionary of named entities identified in the text. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'keypoints\\'`: A list of the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given text chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'tonality\\'`: The overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n\\n2. **Extract Relevant Information:**\\n   - Focus on extracting the most relevant information or identification from each chunk. This could include key themes, essential concepts, or significant details.\\n\\n3. **Perform Named Entity Recognition:**\\n   - Extract named entities from a given text and organize the results, providing the option for individual descriptions for each entity. \\n   - As part of the information extraction, identify and categorize any named entities, including but not limited to PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, etc., within the text.\\n   - The system should present the extracted entities in a structured format, allowing for detailed descriptions or additional information for each identified entity.  \\n   - Follow exactly the example below for the named entities:\\n\\n      named_entities = [\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_1>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_1>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1a>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_2>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1b>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with individual descriptions as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_2>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_3>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_4>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with a common description as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         # Add more entries as needed\\n      ]\\n   \\n   <Tag_1> and <Tag_2> represent different types of named entities.\\n   Each tag contains a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an entity and its associated description.\\n   Each entity can have an individual description.\\n\\n\\n4. **Determine the Tonality:**\\n   - Assess the overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Include this assessment under the key `\\'tonality\\'`.\\n\\n5. **Highlight the Keypoints:**\\n   - Identify and list the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given chunk under the key `\\'keypoints\\'`.\\n\\n6. **Header Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical to headers of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Look for any title case or all uppercase.\\n      - Position: Consider if any text is at the beginning of a section or stands alone.\\n      - Content: Assess if the text is concise and focused.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Note any numbering or special symbols.\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if any text introduces a new topic or section.\\n\\n7. **Subheader Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical of subheaders of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Subheaders often follow title case, but they might not always be in all uppercase, unlike some main headers.\\n      - Position: Check if the text appears within a section, usually following a main header. Subheaders are often used to introduce subtopics within a larger section.\\n      - Content: Determine if the text is more specific than a main header but still concise. It should elaborate on the content introduced by the main header.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Look for secondary or nested numbering or bullet points (e.g., \"1.1 Subsection\", \"• Subpoint\").\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if the text refines or narrows down the topic introduced by the main header, rather than introducing a completely new topic.\\n\\n8. **Generate Tags**\\n   - Please generate tags based on the given relevant information and strictly refrain from generating empty tags or empty array.\\n\\n9. **Provide Clear Details:**\\n   - Clearly present the information extracted from the piece of text. Ensure that the details are concise and informative.\\n\\n10. **Strict JSON Response:**\\n   - Strictly format your response as a JSON object.

Think of how powerful they could make your\\nbusiness. YES, HIRING IS WORTH IT— EVEN IN\\nTHE CULTURE OF AVERAGE\\n\\nI made the mistake of staying small because I thought it was\\njust too hard to find good people and even harder to keep\\nthem. I don’t want you to make this mistake. You must grow and\\nyou must grow through people. More important, you must\\nbecome obsessed with the idea that good employees are vital\\nto your survival. Anyone who gives up on people is\\nguaranteed to not have much of a business. Great employees are vital to\\nyour survival. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nBut hiring anyone, much less attracting and retaining great\\npeople, is a monster problem today. It is such a problem that\\nmost employers, business owners, and even corporations have\\n\\n\\n\\nthrown in the towel. Why? Because they are recruiting from a\\nculture of average. According to Gallup’s 2013 study “State of the Global\\nWorkplace,” only 13 percent of employees worldwide are\\nengaged at work, while 24 percent are actively disengaged,\\nindicating they are unhappy and unproductive at work and\\nliable to spread negativity to coworkers. In rough numbers this\\ntranslates to 900 million not engaged and 340 million actively\\ndisengaged workers around the globe. I actually think it’s worse than this. People are not simply\\ndisengaged at work. They aren’t even at work! Yes, they are in\\nthe building. Yes, they clocked in. Yes, there is a body in the\\nchair. Someone may appear to be sitting in front of the\\ncomputer, maybe even with a phone in hand. But that is it. Many people are doing only what is expected of them and no\\nmore. The majority of employees are filled with resentment\\ntoward their managers, have an inflated sense of entitlement,\\nand operate at levels of incompetence that border on\\nastounding. Most know more about the most recent celebrity\\nscandal than they do about their job. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t great people out there. I\\nknow—I’ve hired the good and the bad. What this means,\\nthough, is that you need to be really tough in hiring and really\\ndiligent. You’re going to need to look through a lot of garbage\\nto find the people you want to work with you. It’s frustrating\\nbut important. Because while you are the designer and driver,\\nyour people are the engine, transmission, and wheels. Your\\ncompany can’t drive forward without them. STOP WHINING ABOUT PAYROLL\\n\\nA lot of people don’t want the expense of paying employees. The truth? People don’t cost money. Not growing your\\nbusiness costs money. Every new hire should bring you more\\n\\n\\n\\nmoney, and if they do not, you don’t have the right crew or are\\nnot managing them correctly. People don’t cost money; not\\ngrowing your business costs\\nmoney. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nI have gone from having five employees to having a\\ncouple of hundred, and as my payroll blew up, the revenue of\\nmy business blew up as well. While the bottom line grew to\\nfive times what it had been, the company’s top line grew to\\nalmost one hundred times what it had been. And that is just the\\nfirst bit of good news. We multiplied our number of customers\\nby eight thousand, the amount of attention we received by\\nmillions, and we created twelve times as many products. On\\ntop of all that, the most valuable result has been that the\\ncompany still has a viable future without my day-to-day\\ninvolvement. I can put my focus and my efforts into the things\\nI do best. Without the help of an expanding expert team, you’re\\nalready guaranteed a loss. So quit complaining about payroll\\ncosts. HOW TO FIND THE BEST\\n\\nYour people are your power. If you don’t surround yourself\\nwith the best, if you don’t create a culture in your company\\nthat is as obsessed as you are with getting you where you want\\nto go, you are not extending your power. If you don’t continue\\nto recruit, you are left to manage with what you have. And the\\npeople you depend on today can disappoint you tomorrow. So\\ninvest in people and keep investing. To do any less means\\nyou’re not obsessed with the well-being of your business. There are lots of ways to go about hiring people, and I\\nshare some ideas below. But first I’ll share something I did\\nthat was totally out of the box. I produced a show called\\nWhatever It Takes. We put more than 250 people through an\\ninterviewing process and recorded it all. We looked at their\\nFacebook pages, in their phones, and in their cars and then put\\nthem through grueling tests—all with cameras in their faces to\\ndocument everything. With their approval, we made it public. The biggest reality we demonstrated by doing that was\\nthis: You have to go through a lot of people to find a few good\\nones. The first season we hired ten people and kept six. In the\\nsecond season we had a better group of people, hired fourteen,\\nand eventually lost them all. Regardless of all the failures, our efforts have allowed us\\nto create a very strong team. Here’s how we did it. DEVELOP A REPUTATION AS A PLACE PEOPLE WANT TO WORK\\n\\nIf you’re pumping out excellent products, making sales,\\nreinvesting, and getting to know people, you are going to get a\\nreputation for doing great work. Let that work for you. If you\\nare doing great things, other people who want to do great\\nthings will find you and want to work with you. Do great things and those\\nwho want to do great things\\nwill find you and want to work\\nwith you. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nThe current vice president of my sales team came to us\\nbecause a customer, his father, was turned on to our Sales\\nTraining University. He told his son: “You need to try to work\\nfor this Grant Cardone guy. ” At the age of twenty-six this son\\nstarted making cold calls, being paid $2,500 a month. Now he\\nruns the entire sales department at my company. I am so busy making noise people want to come work for\\nme and find me. Steve Spray drove from Indiana to Miami to\\nbeg us to hire him! Dave Robards relocated at his own\\nexpenses from Vegas. In fact, my most productive people\\ncame from around the country, not from the local market. ALWAYS BE HIRING—NOT JUST WHEN A POSITION IS OPEN\\n\\nSuper businesspeople make recruiting one of their top\\npriorities. In Larry Van Tuyl’s case, he saw everyone he met as\\nsomeone he could possibly recruit to grow his companies. If you fill only positions that are open and that you have\\ncreated from within your own one-person vision, you are\\nlimiting yourself and won’t find great people. One day I got to watch Larry work to recruit someone:\\nme! He peppered me with questions: “What are you going to\\ndo with your life?” “What’s your biggest dream?” “Are you\\nmarried?” “Do you have a family to take care of?” “When are\\nyou going to get off the road?” “Do you want to run one of my\\ndeals?”\\n\\nI took it as a compliment that Mr. Van Tuyl thought\\nenough of me to ask me to work for him. He knew after\\nmeeting me for the first time that I was trying to do the same\\nthing he was doing in a different space. Those obsessed with\\ngrowing their businesses know they must be recruiting\\nconstantly, not just when it’s necessary or the economy is\\ngood. LET THE WORLD KNOW YOU’RE HIRING\\n\\nTo start you need to hang that “Help Wanted” sign on the door. With social media it’s never been easier. You have every\\nonline outlet available to let the world know you’re hiring. Post on Facebook, Twitter, your web site, LinkedIn, craigslist\\n—post on every possible online forum every day so people get\\nthe message: “Grant Cardone Enterprises is expanding again,\\nand we are hiring. ”\\n\\n\\n\\nDon’t forget about old-school practices either. Place ads in\\nlocal newspapers, local magazines, and national magazines,\\nand get your people to tell their family and friends. Get the\\nword out anywhere you can think of, because for people to\\nfind you, they need to know you want great people to come\\nwork for you. LOOK AT MORE RÉSUMÉS THAN SEEMS REASONABLE\\n\\nWhen I moved my offices from California to Miami, we\\nlooked at eight hundred résumés to hire four people—and we\\nwere wrong on two of those we tried to work with. When it\\ncomes to hiring, you need to be recruiting, looking, hunting,\\nmarketing, and being obsessed at a massive level. That means\\nlooking at massive numbers of résumés. DO INTERVIEWS YOURSELF, AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE\\n\\nHiring isn’t just a matter of reviewing a résumé and checking\\nLinkedIn. It involves an instinctive feel for another person. There is a lot to consider, not just the candidate’s ability to do\\nthe tasks required for the job, but also how he or she will\\nestablish and encourage the company culture you want to\\ncreate.

Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'headers\\'`: A list of headers where a header is a line of text that introduces a new section or chapter in a document. It is typically formatted distinctly from the main body text to stand out, often being bolder, in a larger font, or differently styled. Headers are concise, summarizing the content that follows, and they guide the reader through the document\\'s structure. Strictly, this is a list of strings.

Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'tonality\\'`: The overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n\\n2. **Extract Relevant Information:**\\n   - Focus on extracting the most relevant information or identification from each chunk. This could include key themes, essential concepts, or significant details.\\n\\n3. **Perform Named Entity Recognition:**\\n   - Extract named entities from a given text and organize the results, providing the option for individual descriptions for each entity. \\n   - As part of the information extraction, identify and categorize any named entities, including but not limited to PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, etc., within the text.\\n   - The system should present the extracted entities in a structured format, allowing for detailed descriptions or additional information for each identified entity.  \\n   - Follow exactly the example below for the named entities:\\n\\n      named_entities = [\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_1>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_1>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1a>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_2>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1b>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with individual descriptions as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_2>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_3>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_4>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with a common description as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         # Add more entries as needed\\n      ]\\n   \\n   <Tag_1> and <Tag_2> represent different types of named entities.\\n   Each tag contains a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an entity and its associated description.\\n   Each entity can have an individual description.\\n\\n\\n4. **Determine the Tonality:**\\n   - Assess the overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Include this assessment under the key `\\'tonality\\'`.\\n\\n5. **Highlight the Keypoints:**\\n   - Identify and list the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given chunk under the key `\\'keypoints\\'`.\\n\\n6. **Header Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical to headers of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Look for any title case or all uppercase.\\n      - Position: Consider if any text is at the beginning of a section or stands alone.\\n      - Content: Assess if the text is concise and focused.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Note any numbering or special symbols.\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if any text introduces a new topic or section.\\n\\n7. **Subheader Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical of subheaders of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Subheaders often follow title case, but they might not always be in all uppercase, unlike some main headers.\\n      - Position: Check if the text appears within a section, usually following a main header. Subheaders are often used to introduce subtopics within a larger section.\\n      - Content: Determine if the text is more specific than a main header but still concise. It should elaborate on the content introduced by the main header.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Look for secondary or nested numbering or bullet points (e.g., \"1.1 Subsection\", \"• Subpoint\").\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if the text refines or narrows down the topic introduced by the main header, rather than introducing a completely new topic.\\n\\n8. **Generate Tags**\\n   - Please generate tags based on the given relevant information and strictly refrain from generating empty tags or empty array.\\n\\n9. **Provide Clear Details:**\\n   - Clearly present the information extracted from the piece of text.

If this can happen in my company, you can bet other\\ncompanies are behind with bad or outdated policies, rules, and\\nbeliefs. Look for them and you will find opportunities. Get\\nobsessed with exploiting every weakness of your competition. Use every possible advantage to separate yourself from the\\nmass of average, where businesses are indistinguishable. Do\\nwhatever it takes, within legal parameters, within what is\\nethically and morally sound, to deliver in ways that exploit\\nothers’ weaknesses. Get obsessed with exploiting\\nevery weakness of your\\ncompetition. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nIf they won’t do it, whatever it is, I might offer it to my\\nclients. If they take too long, I will do it now. You don’t want\\nto be doing what everyone else is doing; do what they won’t\\ndo and offer what they won’t offer. Break the rules to make a\\nnew game. MAKE YOUR CUSTOMER THE\\nWINNER\\n\\nBefore presenting your product to a potential client, remind\\nyourself of how your offer is worth more money than you are\\nasking for. That is what makes it the best deal anywhere. Always make sure the buyer gets more value than the\\nmoney exchanged. If a company invests $1. 7 million in a\\ncustomized sales training program and makes $15 million in\\nsales the first year, who got the better deal? The customer. People don’t buy price: They buy the product, the\\nsolution, the people, and the company. Price is just a piece of\\nthe puzzle used to evaluate a product or service, and this is\\ntrue with all your other value offers. In the end your value is\\nwhat’s best because it makes your pricing better, your\\nwarranty better, your financing better, your terms better, your\\nproduct better, your service better. And then there’s the ultimate value-add: you. No other\\ndeal will come with you. When I was selling cars, whether I was selling Toyotas,\\nPontiacs, Renaults, GMCs, or used cars, the deal was rarely\\nthe car—the deal was me. A customer, Warren, once told me,\\n“I can get the same deal down the street for less. ” I replied,\\n“The deal down the street doesn’t come with me, Warren. Sign\\nhere. ” He bought the truck and then bought another eleven\\nvehicles from me. I assure you that he paid me more than\\nanother dealer would have charged—and I promise you he still\\ngot a better deal buying from me. Because I didn’t just sell\\nWarren cars; I serviced Warren and his family constantly. I\\nbecame friends with his family. I treated him and his family\\nlike VIPs, always stopped whatever I was doing to give them\\nattention. The ultimate value-add is\\nyou. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nTell the world you are the best. Sure, it is going to cause\\npeople to think you are “too this” and “too that. ” But just as\\nyou never take advice from people who have quit on\\nthemselves, the person who says you shouldn’t brag has\\nnothing to brag about. Tell the truth about how awesome you\\nare. And then deliver on that truth. W\\n\\nCHAPTER 10\\n\\nBUILD AN OBSESSED TEAM\\n\\nhen I met a business owner whose main mission\\nin life was to scour the earth for top-notch talent,\\nit changed my perspective on what it means to run\\n\\na business. When megasuccessful businessman Larry Van Tuyl, who\\njust sold one of his companies to Warren Buffett for $4 billion,\\nmeets new people, he shakes their hand, pulls them toward\\nhim so they are inches from his face, and says, “I want you to\\ncome work with me!” This guy is intense about recruiting. Everyone is a potential recruit: customers, vendors, strangers,\\nwaiters, waitresses, doormen, kids—anyone, everywhere. Larry runs a multibillion-dollar company involved in real\\nestate, insurance, technology, and automotive. He doesn’t\\nthink small in anything and operates with an almost\\nincomprehensible work ethic that exists in some state well\\nbeyond enthusiasm. Larry spends most of his time recruiting\\nobsessed, all-in, great people who could become extensions of\\nhis own all-in, obsessed mentality. He searches for hungry\\npeople who have an inner drive to show up early and stay late. Ask any great businessperson how they built their\\nbusiness, and somewhere in their answer they will credit\\nhaving surrounded themselves with great people. Simply put:\\nTo be the best, you must surround yourself with the best. You want people on your team who will do anything to\\nsee your business succeed: jump off a building for you, run\\nthrough walls for you, and believe they can fly because of you. If you don’t have anyone like that working for you, shame on\\nyou. You can’t grow a business without surrounding yourself\\nwith people who have that kind of commitment. You can’t be\\nthe only maniac. You can’t grow a business without hiring\\npeople who share your obsession. And there are other\\nobsessed people out there whom you should be hiring. You want people on your\\nteam who will do anything for\\nyou: jump off buildings, run\\nthrough walls, and believe\\nthey can fly because of you. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nYou need to make the obsessed mind-set a part of your\\nbusiness culture from the top down. All great organizations\\nhave great people! All of them. GET BEYOND THE ONE-MAN SHOW\\n\\nGreat organizations are never one-man operations. There are 22 million licensed small businesses in America\\nthat have no employees. Forbes suggests 75 percent of all\\nbusinesses operate with one person. And the average income\\nof those companies is a sad $44,000. That’s not a business—\\nthat’s torture. That is a prison where you are both the warden\\nand the prisoner. What makes a person start a business and then be the only\\nperson who works there? Are they committed to staying\\nsmall? Or maybe an entrepreneur decides that because the\\ntalent pool is so poor, they can’t hire anyone who can do it as\\nwell as them, and they give up. My guess is the latter: Most\\n\\n\\n\\npeople have just given up and said, “It’s easier if I just do it\\nmyself. ”\\n\\nI know, because that’s what I did—and it was suicidal. Because my business was totally dependent on me and only\\nme, I was barely able to survive, much less grow, for the first\\nten years. Instead I contracted another company to promote\\nmy seminars. When I hired just one person to assist me out of\\nmy home office, I thought I was so smart: Keep it small. Keep\\nexpenses low. Run a tight ship. Bigger isn’t always better. These were the things I told myself to justify not growing my\\nbusiness. I did this for years and even bragged about how well\\nI was doing on my own. Then I started a second company with a partner, a\\nconsulting business that ran parallel to my seminar business. This consulting business quickly grew bigger than my first\\nbusiness because my partner hired people to work for us. But\\neven then I resisted bringing other people into the company\\nbecause I had this idea that I didn’t want the headaches and\\ncosts that come with managing people. My margins were monster when I had no employees, but I\\ncould never grow my revenue line without killing myself, and\\nI have since learned that is where all my attention and effort\\nshould have gone. But with the efforts of one person and one\\ncontracted marketing company, I could expand only so much. I know that a lot of speakers and business gurus run their\\ncompanies as one-man shows. Which means that while they\\nare giving advice to others about how to grow a business, they\\nmay have never grown one themselves! Their one-man show\\nis simply a guy or gal going out, collecting a fee, selling time\\nand a few books. And when they are out speaking, the\\nbusiness terminates all activity. I started studying other people and companies that had\\nmade it big and discovered they all had lots of employees. The\\nreality is you cannot have a great business if it’s just you. You\\nneed to add other people. If you don’t believe me, try to name\\none truly great business that is successful, ongoing, viable, and\\n\\n\\n\\ngrowing that doesn’t have many people making it happen. Good luck. Businesses are made of people, not just machines,\\nautomations, and technology. You need people around you to\\nimplement programs, to add passion to the technology, to\\nserve customers, and ultimately to get you where you want to\\ngo. Consider the behemoth online company Amazon: It has\\nmore than 220,000 employees. Apple has more than 100,000;\\nMicrosoft has around the same number. Ernst & Young has\\nmore than 200,000 people. Apple calls the employees working in its stores\\n“Geniuses. ” Don’t you want to hire employees deserving of\\nthat title too? Think of how powerful they could make your\\nbusiness.'}], 'max_tokens': 4096, 'temperature': 0, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}, 'output': {'id': 'chatcmpl-98KepSWdX7tBvOoSiVLAw0auJG0Wb', 'model': 'gpt-4-0125-preview', 'usage': {'total_tokens': 4108, 'prompt_tokens': 3529, 'completion_tokens': 579}, 'object': 'chat.completion', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{\\n  \"summary\": \"The text emphasizes the importance of customer service, competitive strategy, value proposition, personal branding, and building a team with an obsessed mindset for business success.

Here are some statements I now\\nuse to express this confidence to potential customers:\\n\\nI can handle it. I can fix it. I can get it done. I guarantee it. We have the solution. I will figure it out. Leave it with me. Robert Kraft bought the New England Patriots for $172\\nmillion in 1995 with profits from his paper-manufacturing\\nconglomerate. He makes the team start every season with a\\ntotal commitment to dominate the season and win a Super\\nBowl ring. No one on the team is shy about declaring their\\ngoal or promising an incredible viewing experience watching\\nthem battle to get there. Whether you like the Patriots or not,\\nlook at their position, their stance, and their commitment. Is\\nthe team delivering a great service to their customers?\\nAbsolutely. Should they start the season out by\\nunderpromising? Absolutely not. If they started the season underpromising, in hopes that\\nthey could overdeliver, they would never sell $500 tickets and\\n$500,000 corporate box seats. What would the PR team say to\\nthe public? “We don’t expect much out of the upcoming\\nyear”? “We hope to be competitive and give our fans a good\\nseason if no one gets hurt”? No, what they say is “We have\\ninvested in the best talent money can buy so we can bring New\\nEngland another Super Bowl. ”\\n\\nToday the New England Patriots are worth $3. 2 billion. And Kraft has been known for going all in—committing to\\ndoing whatever it takes to win. It pays off for him financially,\\nand you should go in with that same confidence. Deflating\\nyour pitch (pun intended) is costing you money, fame, and a\\nfuture. KEEP REVISING YOUR PITCH\\n\\n\\n\\nYour pitch can always be improved on, shortened, made to hit\\nharder, to get more attention and be more effective. Do not underestimate what I am telling you here. As the\\nexecutive of your own life, you need to learn who you are,\\nwhat your value-add proposition is, and how to pitch yourself. If you don’t have clarity on who you are and what your value-\\nadd is, then no one will. The saying “Don’t toot your own\\nhorn” is another lie spread by the average. Why have a horn if\\nyou aren’t going to blow it?\\n\\nIf you don’t have clarity on\\nwhat your value-add is, then\\nno one will. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nMost people have not given themselves permission to\\nblow their own horn and therefore never take the time to work\\nout their pitch. The reality is if you can’t pitch what you do,\\nwho you are, and what you offer, no one will get obsessed\\nwith what you do and who you are, much less what you have\\nto offer. If you have an established product, spend time\\nlistening to, even recording, what your people are saying to\\npotential customers about your product, the offer, and the\\ncompany. I assure you they are underpitching, underselling,\\nunderpromising, undermarketing, and not being honest with\\nthemselves, your company, or the customer. Hell, you’re\\nprobably underselling yourself too. The only one that benefits\\nfrom that is your competition. Create a pitch that makes your value scream; don’t just\\ntalk about it mildly. I am trying to get you to be more\\noutrageous and break your conservative tendencies. Think\\nabout what you would say if you were given thirty seconds of\\nSuper Bowl commercial time. Make the pitch that huge. Start by making a list of what makes your offering great. Tell the world why you are amazing, why you are the greatest,\\nthe best. You have just manufactured the excuse you need to\\n\\n\\n\\nperform at much higher levels. All you did was create a pitch\\nthat promises you will. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE\\nCOMPETITION’S LOUSY DELIVERY\\n\\nCustomer service is what you offer clients before, during, and\\nafter a purchase. For a customer to perceive these interactions\\nas success, you and your employees must adjust to the needs\\nof that customer. Most people and most companies, however, are unable or\\nunwilling to do this. The customer-service industry has\\nterrified businesspeople with statistics that promote\\nunderpromising. Here are some of them:\\n\\nAn American Express survey done in 2011 suggests that\\n“78% of consumers have bailed on a transaction or not\\nmade an intended purchase because of a poor service\\nexperience. ” I assure you that number has not improved. According to a 2014 survey by Ebiquity, nearly three out\\nof four consumers say they have spent more with a\\ncompany because of a history of positive customer-\\nservice experiences. Per Ruby Newell-Legner, it takes twelve positive\\nexperiences to make up for one unresolved negative\\nexperience. The White House Office of Consumer Affairs says that\\nreports of bad customer-service experiences reach more\\nthan twice as many ears as praise for a good service\\nexperience. You can make this reality work for you. Look at what\\nother companies in your space do, and take a look at what they\\nwill not do—then exploit those things. Over the years, every company accumulates its list of\\npolicies about things that it will and will not do in certain\\ncircumstances. The company creates policies to prevent things\\nthat happened a few times from ever happening again. For\\nexample, an executive throws up his hands and declares,\\n“That’s it! We have a new policy: Salespeople can no longer\\ncontract the customer without legal looking over the\\nagreement first. ”\\n\\nYou can exploit policies like this by being responsive,\\namenable, and flexible. As someone competing against that\\nexecutive Mr. Penalize-All-Because-of-One-Situation, I will\\nexpedite deals by freeing my salespeople up to contract,\\nwithout the added time our competitor needs to have legal\\nreview their agreement. I once called a large real estate company in the Southeast\\nabout a listing it had available. I asked a veteran agent, “What\\nis the cost on a deal that size right now?”\\n\\nShe said, “Sorry, our company has a policy: We aren’t\\nallowed to discuss interest rates or mortgages. ” She had been\\ndoing multimillion-dollar transactions for thirty years and she\\ncouldn’t discuss rates? I hadn’t asked her to lend me money. I\\nwasn’t asking her to commit to a rate. My question was about\\nmoving my interest in the purchase toward the goal line. I was\\npassing the ball off to her so she could move it toward the end\\nzone—and she effectively said, “Do not pass me the ball. From this point forward, I cannot help you, I will not help you,\\nI am not allowed to help you. You are on your own. ” This was\\nridiculous to me. But beliefs like this are rampant in the\\nmarketplace, and it’s up to you to exploit policies that cripple\\nyour competition like this. Look into it. You will be shocked how many companies\\ntoday still, with customers who have access to boundless\\namounts of information, refuse to discuss critical elements\\nnecessary to push a deal to closing. Plumbers and other\\ncontractors refuse to quote a price for their services over the\\nphone because they’re terrified the competition will beat it or\\nthat they will be unable to deliver at the stated price. Their\\n\\n\\n\\nweb site might promise, “We have the best pricing anywhere\\n—call us!” But when you call, they refuse to give you the\\nprice or it takes two days to get it. Exploit that!\\n\\nNo wonder Internet sales are exploiting the limitations of\\nmom-and-pop shops. People don’t have to endure the negative\\nexperience of wanting service that can’t be delivered because\\nof some dumb policy that was created long ago. I do a show each week from my studio at Grant Cardone\\nTV in which I call businesses and search for these neurotic\\nweak points. I say, “Tell me about your offer. ” The things I run\\ninto are sickening. Here are some of them:\\n\\nI called a major retailer. No one answered the phone\\nafter twelve rings. A CrossFit business refused to talk to customers at lunch\\nbecause that hour was “sacred workout time. ”\\nA law firm wouldn’t start any work until it received the\\nretainer because it had been stiffed one time by one\\ncustomer. A real estate broker refused to show property or tell me\\nanything about his offering until I signed a\\nconfidentiality agreement because he had heard a story\\nabout a buyer who went around a broker, directly to the\\nseller, in order to save 3 percent. A boutique watch store wouldn’t give me a price over\\nthe phone. Their excuse? “We don’t want you to shop\\nour price. ”\\n\\nPeople are so busy trying to solve some problem from the\\npast that they miss the opportunity in the moment. I’ve seen\\nthis happen in my own company. My VP of sales wrote a letter\\nto my Internet department, stating that anytime a customer\\nwith a title of VP or higher attempted to buy our Online\\nUniversity offering at our web store, his or her order should\\nnot be processed and that instead the lead should be sent to the\\nsales department to handle. Was he for real? Just imagine you\\nare a VP of a company and want to purchase a program\\n\\n\\n\\navailable online without talking to a salesperson—and can’t.

I have a great company, superior products, unbelievable\\nROI, and exceptional people, so we overpromise and then we\\noverdeliver. In start-up or restructuring phases, you need to\\nhave an embellished image of yourself, your company, your\\npeople, your environment, your offer, and your value\\nproposition. Maybe the world doesn’t know you yet. Maybe your idea\\nis new. Take the time to really look at what you offer. Make a\\nlist of every benefit your customers will experience. Take each\\nproduct and make a full list of all the miracles it will perform. If you are not the greatest out there, you need to become\\nthe greatest. If your name is mentioned to competitors, you\\nwant to make sure that the blood will drain from their face. Here are some claims I can genuinely make, and you need to\\nbe able to make them too:\\n\\nI don’t have competition; I have imitators who don’t\\nhave the bandwidth, guts, resources, energy, persistence,\\nor leadership to deliver at the levels I do. To do business\\nwith anyone other than me is a mistake of massive\\nproportions. I offer the lowest cost and the highest ROI of all the\\ncompanies in my space. You can shop, evaluate, and\\ncompare, and you will find the same thing. The value of what I offer is so high that when a\\ncustomer tells me I am double the price of a competitor,\\nI know I am still eight times cheaper. I show them why,\\neven though I am double the price, I offer a better deal\\nby eightfold. When the competitor asks my new\\ncustomers why they did business with me instead, they\\nsay, “He had a better price. ”\\n\\n\\n\\nBecome obsessed with being the best. Then when you\\noverpromise, it’s not bragging—it’s the truth. When you are a\\nlegit company, you will always rise to the commitment and\\ndeliver. It is not overselling when you can deliver. No one\\nwants average. No one values average. No one will stop for\\naverage or exchange their time and money for average. COMMITTING BIG MAKES YOU\\nDELIVER BIG\\n\\nIf you never overcommit, neither you nor your people will\\never overdeliver. If you don’t push for performance at higher\\nlevels, you will never know how great you and your company\\ncan be. The more I promise the marketplace, the more\\nattention I get, and because of all my screaming about how\\ngreat my offering is, I am forced to deliver. Overpromising\\nallows me to establish and then exceed exceptional levels of\\ndelivery. If you don’t push for\\nperformance at higher levels,\\nyou will never know how\\ngreat you can be. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nIf you’re short on creativity, it’s only because you aren’t\\ncommitted enough. When I am not finding creative ways to\\nexpand, I look at my commitment level and the commitment\\nlevels of those around me. Then I make it a point to raise my\\ngame. I demonstrated this with my sales team recently. I walked\\ninto their offices and said, “Give me everyone you are working\\nright now, and I guarantee I will close a deal in under twenty\\n\\n\\n\\nminutes. ” Everyone got excited and started throwing phone\\nnumbers at me. On the first call an assistant referred me directly to the\\ndecision maker. I got his voice mail: progress, but no close. On the second call I was able to get the customer on the\\nphone. I asked him why he didn’t do anything with us. He\\nsaid, “We weren’t planning on doing anything until the next\\nquarter. ” I made a big claim, telling him, “That’s a shame,\\nbecause I am 100 percent confident we could change your\\nentire year in that first quarter. And if you are going to do it\\nsooner or later, why not get started sooner?” He said, “Send\\nme the contract. I’ll get it back to you today. ”\\n\\nMy staff was shocked. I hung up the phone and thirty\\nminutes later we received the contract. I made a call, made a\\nbig claim, and we closed a deal. Two things to consider here: (1) We earned the business of\\na customer, and (2) my team benefited by watching me in\\naction. I told my team I was going to kill it, and sure enough,\\nsomething good happened. I put the future into my current\\nenvironment by taking action. Once you are fully committed and quit hedging, creative\\nsolutions will show up, I promise you. When you commit completely and have no other option\\nthan to deliver at that level, you will figure out how to get it\\ndone—regardless of how impossible it seems. You are creative\\nto the degree you are committed. And you are successful to the\\ndegree you make that commitment known to the world. When you commit completely\\nand have no other option than\\nto deliver at that level, you will\\nfigure out how to get it done\\n—regardless of how\\nimpossible it seems. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nPut yourself and your product out there, over the edge of\\nsmall thinking, and go big. COMMIT FIRST AND FIGURE THE\\nREST OUT LATER\\n\\nThe obsessed are willing to be reckless. They are willing to\\ncreate and manage chaos in order to get growth. They are\\ngeniuses only because they are courageous. Ask them about\\ntheir courage and they will tell you, “I find my genius when I\\nam completely committed. ”\\n\\nCommit first and figure the rest out later. In the beginning\\nyour need to have order and have it all figured out is going to\\nkick you in your teeth. The fears get unleashed:\\n\\n“How will I get it all done with everything I have going\\non?”\\n“Is it a good deal?”\\n“What if I make a mistake?”\\n“How will I get the financing?”\\n“What if I can’t get financing?”\\n“What about the holidays?”\\n“What if I can’t do what I have promised I can do?”\\n\\nWhat if the world gets hit by a massive comet in the next\\ntwelve hours? This deal will be the least of your problems. Hell, the world might explode before the day ends. So don’t\\nsweat the little stuff. Do not allow yourself to get caught up in\\ndetails. And do not be afraid of venturing into new territory\\nwith your money. Everything you’ve ever accomplished started with a “first\\ntime. ” When I got married, had a baby, handled an IRS audit,\\nstarted my first business, had my second kid, and responded to\\na lawsuit, I just figured it all out as I went along. If you don’t\\nfigure things out along the way, it’s likely because you didn’t\\nfully commit. A few years ago my company invested in all the\\ntechnology needed to do a live webcast from my studio. We\\nset an airdate and started talking about the programs, and\\nseventy-two hours later we went live. We had never delivered\\na live webinar before. Everything you’ve ever\\naccomplished started with a\\n“first time. ” #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nAlmost ten thousand people logged on from all over the\\nworld, and our servers overloaded and crashed. My staff\\nthought I was going to be furious. Instead I was gleeful. I had\\nso much traffic hit my site that it crashed! That’s awesome. I\\nwas running around the office like a kid, chanting, “I broke the\\nInternet!”\\n\\nWe rebooted the site and delivered almost five hours of\\ncontent, without a break, to our audience that night. We made\\nalmost $1 million too. One month later we did another webcast, this time\\npreparing for all of the things that had gone wrong the last\\ntime. We had more than ten thousand people attending, and\\nour servers held. Still, we had new problems and made new\\nmistakes. At the end of that five-hour event, we again took\\nnote of what needed to be changed. Even though we were imperfect, in both cases we actually\\noverpromised and overdelivered. We promised a two-hour\\nevent and delivered a five-hour event, promised a thirty-page\\n\\n\\n\\ne-book and delivered eighty pages. But you can only\\noverdeliver when you fully commit. I will sell a product before it’s finished to raise money—I\\ndon’t want to wait for the income until my team is ready or the\\nproduct is completed. This isn’t so crazy: Software is sold\\nbefore it’s complete every day and problems are fixed with\\nupdates. One of the most successful products ever sold, the\\niPhone, always comes out before the latest version is\\nperfected. You need to think and operate based on a goal of\\nselling your product and generating income, not wait forever\\nfor every piece of your product to be perfect. Those who commit to an investment are crazy enough to\\nsee a future that others cannot yet see. Muhammad Ali lived\\nthis philosophy. He said, “I am the greatest, I said that even\\nbefore I knew I was. ” Whether you can win the fight or not, it\\nwon’t hurt you to sell out every seat and do your best to terrify\\nyour opponent before you get into the ring. Those who commit to an\\ninvestment are crazy enough\\nto see a future that others\\ncannot yet see. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nDELIVER CONFIDENCE\\n\\nMy business exploded when I started making big claims that\\nforced me to show up big, not conservatively.

Given a piece of text, chapterize and generate a JSON format as output. Follow the instructions below to help you in generating the output:\\n\\n1. **Understand the Key-Value Structure:**\\n   - A key-value pair consists of:\\n      - `\\'summary\\'`: A top-level overview or description of the chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'headers\\'`: A list of headers where a header is a line of text that introduces a new section or chapter in a document. It is typically formatted distinctly from the main body text to stand out, often being bolder, in a larger font, or differently styled. Headers are concise, summarizing the content that follows, and they guide the reader through the document\\'s structure. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'subheaders\\'`: A list of subheaders where subheaders are similar to headers but usually introduce subsections within a larger section. They are often formatted to be slightly less prominent than main headers, but still distinct from the body text. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'named_entities\\'`: A list of dictionary of named entities identified in the text. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'keypoints\\'`: A list of the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given text chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'tonality\\'`: The overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n\\n2. **Extract Relevant Information:**\\n   - Focus on extracting the most relevant information or identification from each chunk. This could include key themes, essential concepts, or significant details.\\n\\n3. **Perform Named Entity Recognition:**\\n   - Extract named entities from a given text and organize the results, providing the option for individual descriptions for each entity. \\n   - As part of the information extraction, identify and categorize any named entities, including but not limited to PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, etc., within the text.\\n   - The system should present the extracted entities in a structured format, allowing for detailed descriptions or additional information for each identified entity.  \\n   - Follow exactly the example below for the named entities:\\n\\n      named_entities = [\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_1>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_1>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1a>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_2>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1b>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with individual descriptions as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_2>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_3>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_4>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with a common description as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         # Add more entries as needed\\n      ]\\n   \\n   <Tag_1> and <Tag_2> represent different types of named entities.\\n   Each tag contains a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an entity and its associated description.\\n   Each entity can have an individual description.\\n\\n\\n4. **Determine the Tonality:**\\n   - Assess the overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Include this assessment under the key `\\'tonality\\'`.\\n\\n5. **Highlight the Keypoints:**\\n   - Identify and list the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given chunk under the key `\\'keypoints\\'`.\\n\\n6. **Header Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical to headers of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Look for any title case or all uppercase.\\n      - Position: Consider if any text is at the beginning of a section or stands alone.\\n      - Content: Assess if the text is concise and focused.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Note any numbering or special symbols.\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if any text introduces a new topic or section.\\n\\n7. **Subheader Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical of subheaders of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Subheaders often follow title case, but they might not always be in all uppercase, unlike some main headers.\\n      - Position: Check if the text appears within a section, usually following a main header. Subheaders are often used to introduce subtopics within a larger section.\\n      - Content: Determine if the text is more specific than a main header but still concise. It should elaborate on the content introduced by the main header.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Look for secondary or nested numbering or bullet points (e.g., \"1.1 Subsection\", \"• Subpoint\").\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if the text refines or narrows down the topic introduced by the main header, rather than introducing a completely new topic.\\n\\n8. **Generate Tags**\\n   - Please generate tags based on the given relevant information and strictly refrain from generating empty tags or empty array.\\n\\n9. **Provide Clear Details:**\\n   - Clearly present the information extracted from the piece of text.

If you\\nexpect your people to be as obsessed with sales and new\\nrevenue as you are, meet with them daily and feed their vision. If you work for yourself, you should still have a sales meeting\\nevery day, even if you’re the only attendee. Write down your goals. Keep track of your metrics. Use\\nCRM software and keep track of your contacts, your calls,\\neverything. Analyze your data and use the math to fuel future\\nactions—just as you would if you had a roster of people\\nbehind you. Fifty-two percent of sales managers claim they don’t have\\ntime for sales training. So while you can keep it short, you\\nneed to do it before every shift. How much time you spend in\\nyour meeting isn’t as important as simply having it. Your goal in this meeting is to get your team focused,\\nmotivated, and off to a good start. Before they start making\\ncalls, go over your basic sales presentation. Go over the pitch. Work it out. Have your team perform the pitch, not just tell\\nyou what it is. “Bob, my name is Mike. Grant Cardone wanted\\nme to personally call you and show you something he created\\nthat will increase your sales 20 percent in under thirty days. ”\\nHave everyone repeat it. Then cover the three or four biggest\\nobjections they might hear that day, so your team isn’t hearing\\nthem for the first time with a live customer, and talk about\\nhow to address them. Go over the same thing each day until your team members\\nperfect it before you move on to something else. My goal\\nevery morning is to get my sales team doing one amazing\\nthing, not a hundred half-assed things. I’d rather get them in\\nthe groove of one great thing because this builds certainty. For\\ninstance, a theme at my sales meeting might be “We increase\\nsales 20 percent within thirty days. ” That’s our big claim. Now, my job in this meeting is not to simply give my people\\nthe claim but to show them we are achieving it. My job as the\\nowner is to ensure that the claims my salespeople make come\\ntrue for the customer and then share that with my team to grow\\n\\n\\n\\ntheir confidence and fuel their purpose and obsessions. Every\\nday we share success stories. My goal every morning is to\\nget my sales team doing one\\namazing thing, not a hundred\\nhalf-assed things. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nOther companies run sales meetings in different ways,\\nwith video, audio, guest speakers, music, reports. But\\nregardless of how they run it, the best sales organizations out\\nthere have a meeting every day. Personally, I lead by example,\\nso when I am in the office, I run the meetings. If you leave\\nyour sales team to their own devices, they’ll be corrupted by\\ntheir own doubts and insecurities. Get your team energized\\nand on your page every morning. SELL BY EXAMPLE\\n\\nI will often walk into the sales office and ask to see a list of\\npeople who will not buy our product. Inevitably the\\nsalespeople have a list going. I’ll then pick up the phone and\\nstart calling those people. Regardless of what happens with each call, I’m showing\\nmy salespeople how to be persistent. It’s vital that you teach\\npeople how to keep going in a world that has basically made\\nquitting okay. You need to show your team that you can take\\non an impossible task and confront the things that normal\\npeople quit on. Find the time each day to\\nmake an extra sales call for\\nyour company. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nThe thing is, you can’t teach this with a lecture. We’ve all\\nhad enough of those. You have to demonstrate it.

I\\n\\nCHAPTER 9\\n\\nOVERPROMISE,\\nOVERDELIVER\\n\\n’m sure you’ve heard the old saying a million times:\\n“Underpromise and overdeliver. ”\\n\\nWhile in theory it sounds great to say to a customer, “I\\ndon’t want to overpromise and then underdeliver; I want to\\noverdeliver on what we promise you,” in practice that never\\ninspires me. Yes, I understand the concept, but I don’t believe\\nit is in my best interest to underpromise, underpitch, or\\nunderanything. I am never moderate or conservative when\\nselling, marketing, or branding. I am never moderate or\\nconservative when selling,\\nmarketing, or branding. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nDon’t start out a relationship with a customer based on a\\nlie. Underpromising is a form of deception. You’re not even\\ngoing to get the business by doing that—and it causes the\\nquality of your offering and your service to suffer. If you have\\na great product and a great offering, and your company takes\\ncare of those who use your product, service, or idea, then you\\nare obligated to\\n\\ntell people how great your offering is;\\n\\n\\n\\nmake sure they get it;\\ntake care of customers so that their experience exceeds\\nthe promises you made;\\nrepeat all that so they recommend you to others. When I started my first business, I was working hard but\\nhad not figured out how to get people’s attention. I was\\nmissing something. I finally figured it out; it was not the price,\\nthe offer, the product, or the service that was the problem. The\\nproblem was that I wasn’t making my claims big enough. Once I realized that, everything became possible. I used to say to prospects, “I can help your people make\\nmore sales. ” And my results were horrible, even though it was\\ntrue. Then one day, on a whim, I told a prospect, “I guarantee\\nyou that I will get you one extra sale for every two salespeople\\nby noon today after spending only thirty minutes with your\\npeople. ” He said, “Let’s go. ” Though we didn’t hit that\\nthreshold, the company did have its single best day in months. I realized then and there that if I didn’t believe in me, why\\nwould anyone else believe in me? I had to make big claims to\\nsucceed. At the next place I walked into I introduced myself to the\\nguy running it and said, “How many salespeople do you\\nhave?” He told me he had twelve people, so I said, “Let me\\ntalk to them with you in the room for thirty minutes. It’s nine\\na. m. I guarantee I’ll get you six deals by noon today. ” This\\nwas a big deal to him, as he probably hadn’t gotten six deals in\\nthe last three days and I had promised to do that in three hours. He gave me the thirty minutes and I sold the entire company\\nmy product. They got five deals by noon and two more by\\n2:00 p. m. All of a sudden I was getting people’s attention. I was\\noverpromising, making monster claims. I wasn’t lying; I\\nbelieved I could do what I was promising. When I told\\n\\n\\n\\nsomeone what I could do in a short period of time, it forced\\nme to operate at that level. Because I’m an ethical person, when I overpromise, I am\\nobligated to rise to the occasion and deliver. Only criminals\\ndon’t deliver on what they promise. In the most valuable part\\nof the equation, my offering got better and my delivery got\\nbetter. The rest of this chapter breaks down how this works\\nand how you can make the most of it. When I overpromise, I am\\nobligated to overdeliver. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nMAKE GIANT CLAIMS\\n\\nLook at what works in the world of the giants: giant claims. Here are some big ones:\\n\\nDriving down the road, you see a billboard with a forty-\\nfoot Coca-Cola can and a fifty-foot straw, massive ice\\ncubes, and fizzy bubbles so big you can’t help but get\\nthirsty. The claim? “Happiness in every can!” Wow. How about hamburger ads? Perfect sesame-seed buns,\\ndouble sirloin patties perfectly grilled, shiny tomatoes,\\nonions, pickles, and lettuce. Then they add bacon, which\\ncould make a vegetarian want to be a meat eater. Or what about wrapping the entire side of a twenty-four-\\nstory office building to announce the release of an\\nupcoming blockbuster summer movie?\\n\\nNow compare that with how you market your products\\nand speak to your clients. Making giant claims that can be\\nsubstantiated is not unethical. Having a great product and not\\n\\n\\n\\nproperly pitching it is unethical. Never getting and maintaining\\nsomeone’s attention is treasonous, especially if you have a\\ngreat offering.'}], 'max_tokens': 4096, 'temperature': 0, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}, 'output': {'id': 'chatcmpl-98Ke9PD3ctwh24oqQ9VpfC971VMNr', 'model': 'gpt-4-0125-preview', 'usage': {'total_tokens': 3889, 'prompt_tokens': 3564, 'completion_tokens': 325}, 'object': 'chat.completion', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{\\n  \"summary\": \"The passage emphasizes the importance of daily sales meetings, demonstrating sales techniques, and making bold claims to ensure sales success.

Given a piece of text, chapterize and generate a JSON format as output. Follow the instructions below to help you in generating the output:\\n\\n1. **Understand the Key-Value Structure:**\\n   - A key-value pair consists of:\\n      - `\\'summary\\'`: A top-level overview or description of the chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'headers\\'`: A list of headers where a header is a line of text that introduces a new section or chapter in a document. It is typically formatted distinctly from the main body text to stand out, often being bolder, in a larger font, or differently styled. Headers are concise, summarizing the content that follows, and they guide the reader through the document\\'s structure. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'subheaders\\'`: A list of subheaders where subheaders are similar to headers but usually introduce subsections within a larger section. They are often formatted to be slightly less prominent than main headers, but still distinct from the body text. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'named_entities\\'`: A list of dictionary of named entities identified in the text. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'keypoints\\'`: A list of the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given text chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'tonality\\'`: The overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n\\n2. **Extract Relevant Information:**\\n   - Focus on extracting the most relevant information or identification from each chunk. This could include key themes, essential concepts, or significant details.\\n\\n3. **Perform Named Entity Recognition:**\\n   - Extract named entities from a given text and organize the results, providing the option for individual descriptions for each entity. \\n   - As part of the information extraction, identify and categorize any named entities, including but not limited to PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, etc., within the text.\\n   - The system should present the extracted entities in a structured format, allowing for detailed descriptions or additional information for each identified entity.  \\n   - Follow exactly the example below for the named entities:\\n\\n      named_entities = [\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_1>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_1>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1a>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_2>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1b>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with individual descriptions as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_2>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_3>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_4>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with a common description as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         # Add more entries as needed\\n      ]\\n   \\n   <Tag_1> and <Tag_2> represent different types of named entities.\\n   Each tag contains a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an entity and its associated description.\\n   Each entity can have an individual description.\\n\\n\\n4. **Determine the Tonality:**\\n   - Assess the overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Include this assessment under the key `\\'tonality\\'`.\\n\\n5. **Highlight the Keypoints:**\\n   - Identify and list the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given chunk under the key `\\'keypoints\\'`.\\n\\n6. **Header Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical to headers of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Look for any title case or all uppercase.\\n      - Position: Consider if any text is at the beginning of a section or stands alone.\\n      - Content: Assess if the text is concise and focused.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Note any numbering or special symbols.\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if any text introduces a new topic or section.\\n\\n7. **Subheader Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical of subheaders of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Subheaders often follow title case, but they might not always be in all uppercase, unlike some main headers.\\n      - Position: Check if the text appears within a section, usually following a main header. Subheaders are often used to introduce subtopics within a larger section.\\n      - Content: Determine if the text is more specific than a main header but still concise. It should elaborate on the content introduced by the main header.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Look for secondary or nested numbering or bullet points (e.g., \"1.1 Subsection\", \"• Subpoint\").\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if the text refines or narrows down the topic introduced by the main header, rather than introducing a completely new topic.\\n\\n8. **Generate Tags**\\n   - Please generate tags based on the given relevant information and strictly refrain from generating empty tags or empty array.\\n\\n9. **Provide Clear Details:**\\n   - Clearly present the information extracted from the piece of text. Ensure that the details are concise and informative.\\n\\n10. **Strict JSON Response:**\\n   - Strictly format your response as a JSON object.

To make sure you are continuing to\\n\\n\\n\\nbe engaged with sales, ask yourself:\\n\\nIs what I am doing every day making a difference for the\\nbetter?\\nDo I love my product?\\nDo I love selling my product?\\nDo I own my own product?\\nHave I insisted that my family buy my product?\\nShould people go into debt for my product?\\nDo I continue to call people back after they have told me\\nthey are not interested?\\nCould I charge double for my product and still make\\nsense of the cost?\\n\\nIf you answered yes to every single question, you are pit-\\ntested and ready to race around the track. If you can’t say yes\\nto each of those questions, you are not completely sold on\\nyour product. And if you and your employees don’t believe in\\nwhat you are selling, your efforts will break down and you\\nwill miss sales unnecessarily. Since driving around a track with a malfunctioning engine\\nis simply not an option, the decision comes down to this:\\nEither commit yourself to loving your product or service until\\nyou actually, truly do—as I did when I was selling cars—or\\nchange your product offering. Just don’t wait for the market or\\nyour customers to tell you what to do. You’ve got to take\\ninitiative and do it yourself. ALL THE WAY IS THE ONLY WAY TO\\nCLOSE\\n\\nA major failure of sales organizations is that salespeople and\\nmanagers are running around talking to customers but never\\npresenting figures to them. They make contact with the\\n\\n\\n\\ncustomer, talk to the customer—and then report back to upper\\nmanagement about why the customer didn’t buy. It doesn’t matter that the customer said, “It’s not the right\\ntime for us to buy,” when the salesperson didn’t even present\\nan offer. We did a mystery shopper program with over five hundred\\ncompanies in America and discovered that this happens more\\nthan 70 percent of the time. In fact, never asking for the order\\nis one of the top reasons sales organizations fail. The\\nsalesperson is scared of the competition or rejection or has\\nsome other neurosis, so they refuse to walk the prospect all the\\nway through the sales process to a proposal. I have worked\\nwith tens of thousands of sales organizations and, while this\\nmay blow your mind, I assure you that it’s salespeople’s own\\nfault that they’re losing sales. And the reason it happens is a\\nlack of training and the fact that no one is holding the\\nsalespeople accountable for the little things along the way to\\nclosing. This results in sales cycles that are longer than necessary,\\nrazor-thin margins, and over 50 percent of sales organizations\\nmissing quotas—all because the salesperson never took the\\ntransaction all the way and because the manager never held\\nthem accountable. It’s a simple fact: If you miss a step, you will lose the sale. If you don’t ask for the order, you cannot close the sale. If you don’t present a proposal, you cannot close the\\nsale. If you don’t deal with the decision maker, you will not\\nclose the sale. If you don’t deal with all the influencers, you will not\\nclose the sale. If you don’t solve the magic problem, you will not close\\nthe sale. If you don’t follow up, you will not close most of the\\nsales. If you are not obsessed with closing, you won’t. Go into\\nevery sales situation and customer interaction believing you\\ncan close the sale. If you are not obsessed with\\nclosing the deal, you won’t. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nPUSH YOURSELF AND OTHERS\\nWITH ACCOUNTABILITY\\n\\nI recently saw a survey by the Bridge Group suggesting 50\\npercent of salespeople don’t hit their quotas. Is that because\\nthe quota was too high, or do they fall short because no one\\npushed them to achieve it? I believe people set their targets too\\nlow most of the time and then don’t push their staff hard\\nenough. First off, you should never, ever lower a target—that is the\\ndefinition of failure. Instead, push yourself and others to\\nincreased action. I don’t lower my dreams, goals, or belief in\\nmyself; I increase the pressure I put on myself. Demand that sales quotas be met by holding yourself and\\nyour people accountable for them. Demand that sales quotas be\\nmet by holding yourself and\\nyour people accountable. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nIf one of your salespeople fails to close, ask him or her:\\n\\n\\n\\n“Did you present an offer?”\\n“Did you present terms and figures?”\\n“Did you back off from the close?”\\n“Why did you fail the close?”\\n\\nYou can also hold the salesperson accountable by going\\nright to the source—the person he or she failed to close. Pick\\nup the phone and call a customer who didn’t buy, and ask:\\n\\n“Why didn’t you buy from my guy today?”\\n“What happened?”\\n“Did he ask you to buy?”\\n“Did he present the product?”\\n“Did he present a proposal to you?”\\n\\nI do this all the time. Push and hold your people\\naccountable. This will create a culture of obsession, where\\naccountability is normal and exceeding quotas is expected. You might be wondering, Isn’t “pushing” also\\nmicromanaging? Well, maybe so, but think about it this way:\\nWhen you’re in the hospital, the doctor monitors your body\\nevery second. They’re looking for even minor changes so they\\ncan administer the right medicine immediately. Do you mind\\nbeing micromanaged so the doctor can get you back to work?\\n\\nI will micromanage someone until I don’t have to. If a\\nmanager says, “I don’t want to have to babysit my team,” I\\nknow that this person will come up with every excuse in the\\nbook to explain why the team came up short on their quota. Next thing you know, your business will be laid out on the\\nemergency-room table with a weak pulse. Reward those who achieve\\nand penalize those who do\\nnot. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you don’t hold people accountable, I assure you that\\nsomeone who doesn’t have your best interests at heart will\\ncorrode your efforts. Make sure your team is working toward\\ntheir targets and don’t let them off the hook. Reward those\\nwho achieve and penalize those who do not. Hold managers\\nand executives—including yourself—to ever higher levels of\\nproduction. If you’re at the top of your organization and you\\ncan’t be your own boss, if you need someone to hold you\\naccountable, then join a mastermind group or get a personal\\ncoach to report to. Don’t ease off your sales efforts for even a minute. I\\nwould consider it treasonous to myself, the company, and my\\nfamily if I allowed people to work for me and represent me\\nwho did not either make sales, assist in sales, or attract new\\ncustomers to the company. To make sure this doesn’t happen,\\nwe keep statistics on the contributions and production of every\\nsingle person in the company. If people can’t handle the\\npressure or refuse to contribute, we ask them to leave. You\\nshould too. QUANTIFY YOUR SUCCESS\\n\\nNumbers don’t lie; people lie. I asked one of my guys the other day, “How many people\\ndid you call on today?” He said, “Three or four. ” I replied,\\n“Which was it? Was it three or four? Because there is a big\\ndifference. ” I found out it was actually only two. Show me the numbers. The more important the number is,\\nthe more often I want to see it. I have some sales reported to\\nme every hour. The obsessed sales manager wants to keep\\ntrack of and see all activity: sales attempts, sales contacts,\\npresentations, phone calls, contacts made, proposals,\\nappointments, decisions, and closes. I collect stats on\\neverything important to me in the sales cycle, from proposals\\n\\n\\n\\nto pricing and terms to the contract to the data entered into the\\ncustomer relationship management (CRM) software. Success needs your constant attention. Ignore it and you\\nwill not get it. If you funded a $200 million blockbuster\\nmovie, on opening day you would want a report every hour. You would be hungry for the reports on ticket sales. Not on\\nscripts and actors, not on awards, not even on reviews, because\\nat the end of the day a movie is rated by how well it sells. If\\nyour business ever goes public on Wall Street, you’ll be\\nwatching that stock price every minute. Numbers don’t lie; people lie. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nYour livelihood depends on being obsessed with results so\\nthat you can predict income, expenses, and cash flow. And the\\nbest things to measure your success by are new dollars and\\nnew customers. Your hopes, aspirations, and security are tied\\nup in your ability to make sales—so stay informed. Get obsessed with having reports sent to you throughout\\nthe day. The more important the number, the more often you\\nshould have it sent to you. Everyone will get that you are\\nserious about growth. Get obsessed with “Show me, don’t tell\\nme. ” I don’t trust what people say—I trust what they can show\\nme.

No one who has made a great contribution on this planet\\nrests on their laurels. I know guys who are worth ten times\\nwhat I am worth. I know billionaires. And not one person who\\nhas proven more successful than me has ever once suggested\\nthat I do less or work less. The only people who have\\nsuggested I not be so obsessed are ordinary people committed\\nto average lives. That ain’t me, and after the 2008 collapse, I\\nwill never again be defensive about my obsession. I will\\nalways remember to stay ready to strike—staying dangerous\\nand never complacent. No one who has made a\\ngreat contribution on this\\nplanet rests on their laurels. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nLEARN TO LOVE FEAR\\n\\nFear is an indication of what you should do, not what you\\nshouldn’t do. I have been scared most of my career, and if I am\\nnot scared, I start to worry that I am not challenging myself\\nwith new things. When the economy collapsed, I was so massively scared\\nthat the fear converted into creativity, inspiration, and power. Everyone was scared, but most people’s response was to pull\\nthe covers over their eyes. You have to convert your fear into power. I did this when\\nmy wife turned to me at the start of the recession and asked,\\n“What is going to happen?” I told her, “We are going to die—\\nour world as we know it has come to an end. And I will get us\\nthrough this. We will be different; we will be better. But for\\nright now you will not see me around here much. I commit to\\nyou that I will never again relax. I will never again allow my\\ncommitment to my dreams and to my family to be watered\\ndown by those who have no clue. I have failed you as a\\nhusband and our kids as a father, and I will never allow this to\\nhappen to us again. ”\\n\\nWhen my back was up against the wall and virtually all of\\nmy projects and income were completely frozen, my biggest\\nfear had come to life. The fact that this happened was one of\\nthe great gifts of my lifetime, because the immediate danger\\ngot me completely outside my comfort zone. It forced me to\\ndo what I should have been doing all along. I should have been\\nmarketing and expanding, introducing myself to more verticals\\nand industries, writing books, appearing on radio and\\ntelevision. Fear is an indication of what\\nyou should do, not what you\\nshouldn’t do. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nThe world thought I had been obsessed before? No—now\\nI was obsessed. I was alive again. I was on fire again. I was\\n120 percent into my businesses, pushed by the threat of not\\nsurviving. I was back at the beginning and there was no sense\\nof entitlement. Instead I was waking up every day with an “Eat\\nwhat you kill” mentality. Seize all of the business; take no\\nprisoners; be ethical but never fair; push, shove, and knock\\ndown walls if necessary. It was time to expand while others contracted. It got me\\nbusy doing what I had been doing when I started my first\\nbusiness: making myself known to people who didn’t know\\n\\n\\n\\nme. I committed to having 28 million businesses know my\\nname, not just 20,000 businesses. I was only doing business\\nwith maybe 2 percent of the industry I was focused on. On top\\nof that, I had to overcome the delusion that I could focus on\\nonly one industry at a time. It was scary reaching out to new clients, new industries,\\nnew people. No one knew me. I wasn’t a big shot in these\\nareas; I was a nobody. Every day reminded me of how small\\nand how dumb I had been. I had a great product, I had been in\\nbusiness for twenty-two years, and still no one knew me. As I accelerated right through the fear, I felt I was alive\\nagain for the first time in a long time. This is when I have\\nalways done best: when I am on the move, putting myself out\\nthere, meeting new people, and learning new things. If you do\\nthis often enough, you’ll convert fear into power and\\nconfidence. That said, don’t expect fear to go away and don’t try to\\neliminate it. Use it. The obsessed life is not about reaching a\\nstate of peace and balance. It’s about constantly moving in the\\ndirection of your fears and possibilities. Fear will always be\\nthere, so the question becomes what you will do with it. The obsessed life is about\\nconstantly moving in the\\ndirection of your fears and\\npossibilities. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nFear can be your friend. It can be an asset, a source of\\nenergy, creativity, and inspiration. BE OBSESSED WITH DANGER AND\\nDISCOMFORT\\n\\n\\n\\nCommit yourself to this feeling of discomfort. I’ve become\\nobsessed with the idea of being uncomfortable, because I\\nknow it leads to success. I guarantee that you will not find the\\npath to your purpose inside your comfort zone. The greatest\\nyou will be discovered far outside your comfort zone. The greatest you will be\\ndiscovered far outside your\\ncomfort zone. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nTake a hard look at how committed you are to your\\nsuccess, because you might be on the edge of a cliff, in danger\\ninstead of dangerous. Try this exercise to see where you are:\\n\\nAre you expanding and re-creating who you are? If not,\\nyou are stagnating. Are you reaching for new audiences? If not, you are\\nbecoming obsolete. Are you creating new products? If not, you are\\nuninspired. Are you developing new streams of income? If not, you\\nare on your way to losing money. Are you the biggest fish in a small pond? If so, you are\\ngetting lazy. Are you the smartest person in the room? If so, you are\\nasking for boredom. Are you always worried about one client? If so, your\\npipeline is not full enough. Are you scared at this very moment? If you aren’t, then\\nyou aren’t doing the things that are worth doing. Stay hungry, stay dangerous, stay obsessed—and win. S\\n\\nCHAPTER 8\\n\\nOBSESSED WITH SALES\\n\\nales is not a department, a career, or someone’s job. Sales is the god of any business (no disrespect\\nintended). Sales affects everything: every person, every company,\\nevery industry, and entire economies. Companies die because\\nthey are unable to sell products in quantities great enough at\\nprices high enough. Sales affects everything:\\nevery person, every\\ncompany, every industry, and\\nentire economies. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nSales is not just important to your organization—it is the\\nlifeblood of it. It is everything. If a company does not continue\\nto grow new revenue, it will only shrink. A business does not\\ndepend on manufacturing, research, or ideas—it depends on\\nsales. Whether you’re a manager, running your own company, or\\njust getting started, you need to understand that the most\\nimportant line on the financial statements of every company is\\nthe revenue line. People spend time writing business plans and\\nforget to figure out how to sell the product or idea. Yes, you\\nneed a mission statement and you need product development,\\n\\n\\n\\nbut you’d better figure out just how you’re going to get\\ncustomers to buy from you and how you’re going to generate\\nnew revenue. It doesn’t matter if you run a consulting business from\\nhome, have a hair salon, or are the CEO of a multinational\\ncorporation—you have to have a product or service to sell, you\\nneed to get attention for it and sell it in the market, and you\\nneed to expand your customer base. Sales is the only thing a\\nperson can do to guarantee that they control the top line of\\ntheir business. It is impossible to make anything happen\\nwithout sales. I didn’t get into sales because\\nI liked it. I got into it to\\nsurvive. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nIf you say, “I don’t like sales,” or “I am not a sales type”\\nand decide you’re not going to participate, you are not\\nobsessed enough with your dreams. Anyone who says they\\ndon’t like sales is really denying the holy grail of business. I\\ndidn’t get into sales because I liked it. I got into it to survive. The viability of any ongoing organization depends on new\\nsales and new customers. Any company dependent upon only\\na few customers becomes too dependent on too few customers. You need lots of customers paying prices that have high\\nmargins. You need to become obsessed with making new\\ncustomers and bringing in new money.

His philosophy echoes that of the great Andrew Carnegie, who\\nsaid, “The way to become rich is to put all your eggs in one\\nbasket and then watch that basket. ”\\n\\n\\n\\nYou are at risk every moment\\nyou aren’t investing in the\\nexpansion of your business. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nThe reason you are taught to diversify is because\\n“experts” assume that you are lazy and that you will never do\\nthe necessary homework to properly invest. Plus, if you\\ndiversify, you will need professional help to do so—and will\\nneed to hire that “expert” as well as mutual-fund managers,\\nfinancial planners, banks, stockbrokers, bond traders, and\\nother capitalists. Shift your energy into offensive spending and investing. Be obsessed with putting every ounce of your energy, time,\\nmoney, and other resources into the accumulation of new\\nincome. Put your money on the line to get your income high\\nenough so that you can take 30 percent to 40 percent of your\\nincome and reinvest it back into business expansion. Be willing to risk waste to grow. And invest knowing that\\nnot all of your investment will have returns visible to you. There’s not one ad, marketing campaign, branding campaign,\\nor social media post I have done where I regret spending that\\nmoney. You always need more exposure. I never stop and\\nregretfully say, “Oh, I didn’t get a return on that investment. ”\\nReturn on investment is a lie you tell yourself so that you\\ndon’t think you need to spend money. It’s a justification for not\\nspending. Return on investment is a lie\\nyou tell yourself to justify not\\nputting money at risk. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\n\\n\\nYou must spend, and continue to spend, while you focus\\non growing your revenue. You need to make enough money,\\nraise enough money, or borrow enough money to expand. Especially when you are just starting out in your business,\\nfocusing on revenue that you can then reinvest is more\\nimportant than getting good margins. Your top line must be the\\npriority. When you invert the traditional “savings first” mentality\\nand start obsessing about how much money you can reinvest,\\nsomething magical happens. You are forced to go out and\\ncreate, to think of new ways you can build your business up. You start to conquer new markets to get new income. It takes guts and courage to make money today. If you\\ndon’t invest in yourself, don’t expect customers to invest in\\nyou. Put your money at risk and into the marketplace. Invest\\nmoney back into the marketplace to earn even more, and you\\nwill see soaring levels of success. SAY YES TO NEW TECHNOLOGY\\n\\nWhen new and unfamiliar technology comes out, hop on that\\nbandwagon immediately. Learn how to use it and start to wield\\nit—until something newer and better comes out. When Periscope and Facebook’s video-streaming service\\nlaunched, I immediately downloaded the apps. I started\\nstreaming live to people every day whom I didn’t even know\\nand who didn’t yet know me, and I used the new technology as\\nit could best support my goals. Within three months I was\\namong the top five streamers in the world. To continue to grow your company, your network, and\\nyour dominance in the marketplace, you have to embrace and\\nbecome obsessed with every technology that can introduce\\nyou to unfamiliar people, strange environments, and new\\nthings. Become an early adopter and take the leap into the\\nunfamiliar. PLAY THE ROLE UNTIL IT’S REAL\\n\\nWhen I do something for the first time, I remind myself to take\\nchances, get known, have an opinion, make something happen,\\ninspire people to remember me, and be dangerous enough to\\nget whatever the biggest outcome can possibly be for that\\nsituation. I make a decision to own the place, the stage, or the\\ninterview. I decide what I know, what I can offer and gain, and\\nI live and die by that. In other words, I always play the role of someone who\\nknows what he’s doing and who is massively successful, even\\nif I’m not yet. I become the guy who acts as if he knows what\\nhe is doing, talks like he knows what he is doing, and knows\\nthat he can sell anyone on anything. I tell my wife, who is an\\nactress, “You know, I am really an actor playing a\\nbusinessman. ” Here are a few of my credits:\\n\\nOne night I had to walk through what was considered to\\nbe a very dangerous part of New Orleans to get back to\\nmy hotel. I acted as if I were the most dangerous person\\non the street. No one bothered me. When I was pitching my show Turnaround King to\\nNational Geographic Channel executives, I told them, “I\\nguarantee this show will be the most successful show\\nyou have on NatGeo. ” They bought eight segments. In my first real estate portfolio purchase over $50\\nmillion, I faced thirty-eight other bidders and I didn’t\\neven know where I was going to get the money to invest. But I called the sellers and the brokers and told them, “I\\nam your only buyer. I guarantee you will not be\\ndisappointed: I will close faster than anyone else\\nbecause I am the only decision maker. I know you have\\nnever done a deal with me and I am not your highest\\nbidder, but I give you my word I will close this deal. ”\\nForty-five days later I closed the year’s biggest private\\n\\n\\n\\nacquisition of real estate in Florida. That was four years\\nago. I paid $32 million, and the property was just valued\\nat $108 million. I assume the role of a\\nsuccessful person, even if I’m\\nnot yet. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nSTAY IN POSITION TO STRIKE\\n\\nThe legends of success know how to go all in when the\\nmoment presents itself. They step into dangerous\\nenvironments and take advantage of them. During the 2008 economic collapse, Warren Buffett\\nstepped in and loaned Goldman Sachs $5 billion in a killer\\ndeal that ensured his group a 10 percent return and full\\nprotection with preferred shares of Goldman Sachs stock. He\\ndid this while the banks were barely paying one quarter of 1\\npercent on money. Who gets the kind of a deal that pays you\\n40X on your money? The most dangerous person in the space. NEVER REST ON YOUR LAURELS\\n\\nWarren Buffett stayed dangerous during the economic collapse\\nof 2008. Unfortunately, I can’t say the same for myself. Years before the crash, when my successes were\\naccumulating, I started to ease off on setting new goals. I\\nstopped rebooting my purpose, and because my obsession was\\nbeginning to soften, I was much less busy. I was watering\\ndown my successful creed of relentless push, total\\n\\n\\n\\ncommitment, and demanding work ethic in favor of finding\\ntime to “relax,” to step off the playing field, to take it easy\\nduring “reward yourself” weekends, five-hour golf games,\\ndinners out, “quality time” at home, and more introspection. Had I not been seduced by the popular and unwanted\\nadvice of so many, had I just kept feeding my obsessive\\npursuits, I would have been in a completely different position\\nwhen the markets collapsed. I would have been able to buy\\ncompetitors for nothing, take market share that I used to have\\nto fight for, and buy real estate for pennies. I would have had\\nthe courage and the cash to expand my empire a hundredfold. Yes, there could have been great opportunity in those\\ntimes. But because I’d been operating at less than obsessed\\nlevels leading up to it, I had to start over again in many\\ninstances: rebuild my business and my brand and operate\\nevery day with financial fear, scratching and clawing for\\nsurvival. I had put my new wife and baby, my employees, my\\nbrand, and my dreams at risk. I was forced to reconnect with my obsession again, though\\nnow it wasn’t a choice—it was survival. It’s interesting to me that years later I realize that almost\\nall of the friends and philosophers who so generously shared\\ntheir concern for my life and well-being a decade ago have\\nlong since moved on with their lives and out of mine. Many\\nfiled for bankruptcy or lost their jobs or struggled mightily to\\nhold on to their assets and their homes. Many went underwater\\non their mortgages. Customers who had suggested I slow\\ndown and take it easy all went out of business. The\\npsychologist and counselors who diagnosed and labeled me\\nwith an endless list of problems—and never solved any of\\nthem—all canceled their office leases. In the fallout I even discovered that the promoter of my\\nseminars had been stealing from me for years. Despite that, he\\nstill had to file for bankruptcy; his company was in shambles,\\nand all the people he employed were suddenly out of work. Me, I survived. I rebuilt my hustle muscle, rediscovered\\nmy purpose, and refueled my obsessions in some of the worst\\neconomic conditions this country has experienced. I had bought the bad advice, I had started resting on my\\nlaurels, and on some level I knew it was bad going in. I can\\nnow recognize the signs that I’m getting complacent and not\\nbeing obsessed with my obsessions.'}], 'max_tokens': 4096, 'temperature': 0, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}, 'output': {'id': 'chatcmpl-98KdWHjIUDFn1gBnXwYWj8Qnu03qc', 'model': 'gpt-4-0125-preview', 'usage': {'total_tokens': 4089, 'prompt_tokens': 3563, 'completion_tokens': 526}, 'object': 'chat.completion', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{\\n  \"summary\": \"The text emphasizes the importance of investing aggressively in one\\'s business and adopting a mindset of relentless pursuit of growth and expansion.

Given a piece of text, chapterize and generate a JSON format as output. Follow the instructions below to help you in generating the output:\\n\\n1. **Understand the Key-Value Structure:**\\n   - A key-value pair consists of:\\n      - `\\'summary\\'`: A top-level overview or description of the chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'headers\\'`: A list of headers where a header is a line of text that introduces a new section or chapter in a document. It is typically formatted distinctly from the main body text to stand out, often being bolder, in a larger font, or differently styled. Headers are concise, summarizing the content that follows, and they guide the reader through the document\\'s structure. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'subheaders\\'`: A list of subheaders where subheaders are similar to headers but usually introduce subsections within a larger section. They are often formatted to be slightly less prominent than main headers, but still distinct from the body text. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'named_entities\\'`: A list of dictionary of named entities identified in the text. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'keypoints\\'`: A list of the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given text chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'tonality\\'`: The overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n\\n2. **Extract Relevant Information:**\\n   - Focus on extracting the most relevant information or identification from each chunk. This could include key themes, essential concepts, or significant details.\\n\\n3. **Perform Named Entity Recognition:**\\n   - Extract named entities from a given text and organize the results, providing the option for individual descriptions for each entity. \\n   - As part of the information extraction, identify and categorize any named entities, including but not limited to PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, etc., within the text.\\n   - The system should present the extracted entities in a structured format, allowing for detailed descriptions or additional information for each identified entity.  \\n   - Follow exactly the example below for the named entities:\\n\\n      named_entities = [\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_1>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_1>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1a>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_2>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1b>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with individual descriptions as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_2>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_3>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_4>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with a common description as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         # Add more entries as needed\\n      ]\\n   \\n   <Tag_1> and <Tag_2> represent different types of named entities.\\n   Each tag contains a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an entity and its associated description.\\n   Each entity can have an individual description.\\n\\n\\n4. **Determine the Tonality:**\\n   - Assess the overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Include this assessment under the key `\\'tonality\\'`.\\n\\n5. **Highlight the Keypoints:**\\n   - Identify and list the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given chunk under the key `\\'keypoints\\'`.\\n\\n6. **Header Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical to headers of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Look for any title case or all uppercase.\\n      - Position: Consider if any text is at the beginning of a section or stands alone.\\n      - Content: Assess if the text is concise and focused.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Note any numbering or special symbols.\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if any text introduces a new topic or section.\\n\\n7. **Subheader Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical of subheaders of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Subheaders often follow title case, but they might not always be in all uppercase, unlike some main headers.\\n      - Position: Check if the text appears within a section, usually following a main header. Subheaders are often used to introduce subtopics within a larger section.\\n      - Content: Determine if the text is more specific than a main header but still concise. It should elaborate on the content introduced by the main header.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Look for secondary or nested numbering or bullet points (e.g., \"1.1 Subsection\", \"• Subpoint\").\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if the text refines or narrows down the topic introduced by the main header, rather than introducing a completely new topic.\\n\\n8. **Generate Tags**\\n   - Please generate tags based on the given relevant information and strictly refrain from generating empty tags or empty array.\\n\\n9. **Provide Clear Details:**\\n   - Clearly present the information extracted from the piece of text.

The first move I made away from my hometown, a small\\ncity in southwest Louisiana, was for a new job in Chicago. Then I moved to Houston. It was a good move but not the\\nright one—I moved where I knew people (my brother and two\\nsisters were there), as opposed to where I really wanted to live. After that I moved to La Jolla, California, where I knew\\nno one. I lived there for twelve years before I found myself too\\ncomfortable again. Everyone knew me, but that meant I wasn’t\\nmeeting new people and growing anymore. Also, I wanted to\\nfind my wife and start a family, and it was clear that this\\nwouldn’t happen for me in the San Diego area. I packed up and moved to the big city of Los Angeles. Again, I knew no one there. But in LA I found my wife—in\\nfact, I met her the first night I was there. Even though I had no\\nfriends there initially, we built up a big network. I continued to\\nbuild my business and thrive. Fast-forward to a few years later: I was still successful but\\nfeeling that itch of being too comfortable again. So three years\\nago Elena and I picked up and left all our familiar and\\ncomfortable surroundings and moved across country to Miami. All of these moves proved to be monster personal growth\\nbuilders for me. They gave me confidence that I can be\\nnimble, succeed anywhere, make friends anywhere, and create\\nmy own happiness independent of location.

There is no growth in staying where you are. There is no opportunity in comfort.

Do you want to know what has terrified me?\\n\\nSpeaking to five salespeople in Rockford, Illinois, when\\nI was twenty-nine years old\\nThe first time I did a radio interview with Adam Carolla\\nMy first TV interview with Neil Cavuto on Fox News\\nSpeaking to a thousand top agents with Northwestern\\nMutual, all of whom earned $1 million a year\\nSpeaking at the Pentagon to generals, colonels, and\\ntroops in transition\\nSpeaking to four hundred people at a church in\\nNashville about economics and spirituality\\n\\n\\n\\nI was terrified in every one of those situations. They were\\nall uncomfortable for me. Still, I stayed dangerous by reaching\\nout of my comfort zone and meeting new people who could be\\nhelpful to know then or at some point in the future. IT’S OKAY TO BE UNPOPULAR\\n\\nYou can look like everyone’s favorite uncle and still be the\\nmost dangerous person in the space. You can be nice to\\neveryone, respectful, and have good manners, but success is\\nnot a popularity contest. I was working on a huge $32 million real estate deal\\nrecently in Savannah, Georgia. All parties had agreed on a\\nprice, and we were moving forward. But toward the end of my\\ndue-diligence period, I realized it was in my best interest to\\nrenegotiate the price. I knew everyone was going to freak out;\\nnot only did I want to renegotiate, but this was in December,\\nso all the buyers were already in holiday mode, thinking about\\ntime out of the office for Christmas and New Year’s. Success is not a popularity\\ncontest. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nI called the listing agent and said, “We have to pass on the\\ndeal. It no longer makes sense at the price we agreed on. ”\\nEveryone got very tense and very emotional. The broker\\nimmediately started to worry about his reputation with the\\nseller, not to mention his commission. Also, by asking for a\\ndiscount I risked being labeled a “retrader” (a buyer who gets\\na deal under contract and then renegotiates the price after the\\nproperty has been removed from the market). No one wants to\\nbe seen as a retrader. But if I stayed in the deal at the already-\\nnegotiated price, I’d be guilty of practicing bad business. I\\nknew I needed to renegotiate despite everyone getting upset. Either way, I thought, I am in danger. If I buy at the price we\\npreviously agreed on, I am in danger. If I renegotiate, I am in\\ndanger. I’d rather be dangerous than be in danger, I decided. I got on a very tense call with the people involved in the\\ndeal. A few moments into the conversation the broker said to\\nme, “How much money do you need to make sense of closing\\nthe deal?” I called him again and said, “$29. 2 million. ” This\\nturned into three weeks of cursing, threats of lawsuits,\\nhostility, and uncertainty. But we closed the deal at $29. 2,\\nsaving me $2. 8 million. My wife asked me, “How can you do this? Everyone is\\ngoing to hate you. ” And I said, “I would rather others think\\nless of me than think less of myself. I would rather a broker,\\nagent, and seller think less of me than put myself, my\\nbusiness, my future, and you in further danger by playing the\\n‘nice guy. ’”\\n\\nI would rather others think\\nless of me than think less of\\nmyself. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nI am not willing to go along just to get along. I wasn’t\\ntrying to play games with these people or retrade. There have\\nbeen plenty of deals where I paid the price originally agreed\\nupon. But in this case I had to renegotiate, and I am glad I did. As it has turned out, the property would have been a good deal\\nat the higher price—but it’s a better deal at the price I paid. I have an obligation to make great deals, and I am willing\\nto put myself in harm’s way to ensure that the greater priorities\\nare never compromised. Deal making is an art, and I could\\nwrite an entire book on negotiating deals. But there is a line I\\nwon’t cross and it’s simple: If I can’t make sense of the ask, I\\ndon’t ask. If I wouldn’t want it done to me and couldn’t make\\nsense of it if I were in their shoes, then I don’t cross the line. But if I could make sense of the reasoning if I were on the\\n\\n\\n\\nother side, then I am going to push, and I will push hard to sell\\nmy view of the situation. I know what it takes to make $2. 8 million, and as long as I\\ncan make sense of why I am doing what I am doing, I am\\nwilling to put myself into three weeks of emotional danger and\\nunpopularity to avoid years of economic danger. TAKE RISKS WITH YOUR\\nINVESTMENTS\\n\\nThe entrepreneur puts his or her own capital at risk. This is the\\nrole’s very definition: a person who organizes and operates a\\nbusiness or businesses, taking on greater-than-normal financial\\nrisks in order to make money. (I’d argue that that definition is\\nnot quite right, because you can’t actually make money. The\\nFederal Reserve makes money; you put what you have today\\nat risk to collect it from others, hold it for a while until you\\nreinvest it, then do the same over and over. )\\n\\nInvesting in a new business venture is dangerous. You are\\nputting your time, energy, resources, and name at risk in order\\nto make money. But you are also at risk when you work for\\nsomeone else and/or invest in someone else’s ideas. Why not\\npour everything into your own business?\\n\\nMiddle-class Americans have been brainwashed to\\ndiversify their investments. We were taught to play the long\\ngame and be safe. But the legends of investing tell us\\notherwise.

Given a piece of text, chapterize and generate a JSON format as output. Follow the instructions below to help you in generating the output:\\n\\n1. **Understand the Key-Value Structure:**\\n   - A key-value pair consists of:\\n      - `\\'summary\\'`: A top-level overview or description of the chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'headers\\'`: A list of headers where a header is a line of text that introduces a new section or chapter in a document. It is typically formatted distinctly from the main body text to stand out, often being bolder, in a larger font, or differently styled. Headers are concise, summarizing the content that follows, and they guide the reader through the document\\'s structure. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'subheaders\\'`: A list of subheaders where subheaders are similar to headers but usually introduce subsections within a larger section. They are often formatted to be slightly less prominent than main headers, but still distinct from the body text. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'named_entities\\'`: A list of dictionary of named entities identified in the text. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'keypoints\\'`: A list of the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given text chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'tonality\\'`: The overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n\\n2. **Extract Relevant Information:**\\n   - Focus on extracting the most relevant information or identification from each chunk. This could include key themes, essential concepts, or significant details.\\n\\n3. **Perform Named Entity Recognition:**\\n   - Extract named entities from a given text and organize the results, providing the option for individual descriptions for each entity. \\n   - As part of the information extraction, identify and categorize any named entities, including but not limited to PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, etc., within the text.\\n   - The system should present the extracted entities in a structured format, allowing for detailed descriptions or additional information for each identified entity.  \\n   - Follow exactly the example below for the named entities:\\n\\n      named_entities = [\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_1>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_1>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1a>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_2>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1b>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with individual descriptions as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_2>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_3>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_4>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with a common description as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         # Add more entries as needed\\n      ]\\n   \\n   <Tag_1> and <Tag_2> represent different types of named entities.\\n   Each tag contains a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an entity and its associated description.\\n   Each entity can have an individual description.\\n\\n\\n4. **Determine the Tonality:**\\n   - Assess the overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Include this assessment under the key `\\'tonality\\'`.\\n\\n5. **Highlight the Keypoints:**\\n   - Identify and list the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given chunk under the key `\\'keypoints\\'`.\\n\\n6. **Header Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical to headers of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Look for any title case or all uppercase.\\n      - Position: Consider if any text is at the beginning of a section or stands alone.\\n      - Content: Assess if the text is concise and focused.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Note any numbering or special symbols.\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if any text introduces a new topic or section.\\n\\n7. **Subheader Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical of subheaders of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Subheaders often follow title case, but they might not always be in all uppercase, unlike some main headers.\\n      - Position: Check if the text appears within a section, usually following a main header. Subheaders are often used to introduce subtopics within a larger section.\\n      - Content: Determine if the text is more specific than a main header but still concise. It should elaborate on the content introduced by the main header.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Look for secondary or nested numbering or bullet points (e.g., \"1.1 Subsection\", \"• Subpoint\").\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if the text refines or narrows down the topic introduced by the main header, rather than introducing a completely new topic.\\n\\n8. **Generate Tags**\\n   - Please generate tags based on the given relevant information and strictly refrain from generating empty tags or empty array.\\n\\n9. **Provide Clear Details:**\\n   - Clearly present the information extracted from the piece of text. Ensure that the details are concise and informative.\\n\\n10. **Strict JSON Response:**\\n   - Strictly format your response as a JSON object.

On the professional side, I began to think about\\nwhat it meant to be a “sales genius. ” I revolutionized the sales\\ngame when I was thirty years old and am still doing it today. I’ve created best-selling audio and video programs and have\\nwritten books, all related to sales and growing a business. Being a sales genius also meant I could talk about\\ndifferent topics within sales, including closing the sale,\\ncustomer service, customer control, follow-up, cold-calling,\\nrunning a telemarketing team, long sales cycles, retail sales,\\nInternet sales, webinars, selling from the stage, real estate\\nsales, insurance sales, and on and on. Once I had this list, I came up with a short statement of\\nwho I am and why I dominate this particular area of expertise. My statement was “I am the Godfather of Sales. No one is\\nbetter, no one is more current, no one is more effective or\\nrelevant than me. It might sound like I am bragging but it’s not\\nbragging if it’s true. The biggest companies in the world trust\\nme and my company to help them customize sales approaches\\nand customer experience approaches to improve results. ”\\n\\nNext I came up with the benefits I could offer others in\\neach of these categories to further clarify my message to the\\nworld about what I can do for people. I know that I can teach\\nanyone how to be great at sales and like it. I can take a good\\nsalesperson and make them great. I can take a great\\nsalesperson and make them a master. I can even take a person\\nwho hates sales and show them how to be brilliant at it. You will also notice opportunities to expand\\nprofessionally from the points you listed on the personal side. For example, working with the military gave me the idea and\\npassion to help transitioning veterans with sales training. Fast-\\nforward some years, and I was speaking to transitioning vets at\\nthe Pentagon, Fort Bragg, and Fort Benning, as well as\\ngenerals in Bogotá, Colombia. Once I completed my chart, it gave me the ammunition to\\nmake a list of everywhere I could start to get my message out\\n—this is how I began to dominate my brand (more on that in\\nthe next section). But the process of writing out what my\\nexpertise was and why helped me push myself to the next\\nlevel. Be relevant and obsessed. Use the little exercise above to clarify what you are the\\nbest at and what you are an expert in. But remember: This will\\nkeep changing and expanding throughout your life. Revisit this\\nexercise and run it again to give you the fuel you need to\\ntackle any industry you’re in. Stay in the game and keep feeding your obsession with\\ndominating your space—and even multiple spaces—and you\\nwill see that you can do more than you have even dreamed. DOMINATE YOUR BRAND\\n\\nIn the past few years I became one of the leading authorities\\non social media. Actually, I am being humble when I say that. Last year my online presence hit almost 200 million people. When I started using social media, someone asked me,\\n“How do you calculate the ROI (return on investment) on your\\nsocial media?” I looked at him and said, “I am not doing social\\nmedia for customers. I am doing it because I am obsessed with\\nowning my sector and making my name synonymous with\\neverything sales. I want every sales organization in the world\\nto know me. And I want to dominate my competition and put\\nthem on their heels. I want to incite fear in my competitors and\\nkick them into complete submission until they admit to\\nthemselves, Cardone will outspend me and outwork me. ”\\n\\nI became obsessed with communicating to the world my\\nideas, my solutions, and my opinions, and I found every outlet\\npossible to push my content through. If content is king, I\\nbecame a content factory and used every possible means to\\ncommunicate with the world. I put out 78,000 Twitter posts in\\nforty-eight months and nine thousand videos in sixty months. Is that too much? Not if you want to dominate your brand. Did\\nit bother some people? Maybe, but my competitors gave me\\nspace to conquer. Clearly I use social media far beyond any normal, maybe\\neven civil, amount—but it’s not too much, it’s what is\\n\\n\\n\\nnecessary. Just today I told my Internet department (I call them\\nmy Internet department, not IT or communications or anything\\nlike that) to gather enough content to post a tweet every six\\nminutes, for a total of one hundred unique tweets each day. Anyone who says this is too much doesn’t understand the\\nenormity of the Internet and social media space. It’s massive. Can you fill up the ocean by throwing a rock into it?\\n\\nThe reason so many people fail with social media,\\nmarketing, and even traditional advertising is that they\\nunderestimate the effort required to dominate their niche. The reason so many people\\nfail with marketing, is that\\nthey underestimate the effort\\nrequired to dominate their\\nniche. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nI will give you the perfect example. When social media\\nbecame a way of life, three groups formed: (1) those who\\nresented it; (2) spectators (those used by it); and (3) those who\\nused it to market and get themselves known. The first two\\ngroups are massive. I was originally in the first group,\\nresenting these platforms because I didn’t understand them. But soon enough I quit resenting social media when I\\ndiscovered what a powerful tool it was and started using every\\nchannel ferociously. I mean, come on—the platforms were\\nfree and had no limits on how often I could post in them. Before long I was posting so often that others wondered, How\\ndoes Cardone do that? How big is his company? How much\\ndoes he work?\\n\\nI went from not understanding social media to being one\\nof its top global users because I am obsessed with getting my\\nname associated with everything sales and realized social\\nmedia could get me there. I took my expertise (having the best,\\nmost relevant information on sales) and translated it into a\\ndominant brand. You can make positive changes to dominate every sector\\nof your life starting today. You can do twenty push-ups right\\nnow and start to change your physical condition. You can get\\non the phone right now and make a sale to improve your\\nfinances. You can send a video to one of your kids or your\\nspouse while you’re at work, letting them know you want to\\nset aside quality time. You can combine, feed, and strengthen multiple areas at\\nonce, as long as you are obsessed with them. The rising tide of\\nyour effort can lift all the boats of your life, if you choose to\\ndominate. T\\n\\nCHAPTER 7\\n\\nSTAY DANGEROUS\\n\\nrying to avoid danger in a world that is filled with it is\\nimpossible. Bad things happen to good people every\\nday. Good employees get laid off. Companies treat\\n\\ntheir employees well and lose them to other companies\\noffering better perks. Sometimes you lose money before you\\nmake money. Customers betray you for the competition. Your\\nspouse leaves you. Employees screw up. The stock market will\\nnot coddle you and the economy punishes good people and\\nbad people alike. Avoiding danger makes\\nsense only if you want to\\nmake cents. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nBy being careful and trying to avoid danger, people\\nactually spend their lives in danger. Avoiding danger makes\\nsense only if you want to make cents. The only way to reduce\\nrisk is to take risk. While it might seem counterintuitive, it is actually safer to\\nbe at sea than tied up in the harbor. Especially because that big\\nship you have wasn’t built for the harbor—it was built for\\ndeep waters, high swells, and long journeys to where the big\\nfish swim and treasures await. Comfort is your biggest threat\\n—because in your effort to find it or maintain it, you lose out\\non making gains toward your potential. The only way to guarantee your safety is to become\\nobsessed with being the most dangerous person in your space. If you aren’t dangerous, you are a threat to no one and will be\\npushed around by competitors, customers, vendors,\\nemployees, your spouse, and even your kids. Don’t live any more of your life cowering, being fearful,\\ntimid, or accommodating. Here are some ways you can always\\nstay dangerous. GET OUT OF YOUR HOMETOWN\\n\\nAccording to a 2008 Pew research report, 88 percent of all\\npeople live within a couple miles of where they grew up. The best moves of my life have been when I left familiar\\nand comfortable settings. Comfort is the enemy of the\\nobsessed.

Once you have that under control and you’re dominating your\\npersonal finances, you can work to remove all financial doubt\\nfrom the heads of your family, friends, business partners,\\nemployees, and clients. Answering these questions is an exercise that will reveal\\nhow money confident you are and whether you’re dominating\\nyour money:\\n\\nWhat is your money mantra?\\nWhat do you think about money?\\nHow much is a lot of money to you?\\nHow much is too much money?\\nHow much is too little money?\\nWhat are your negative ideas about money?\\nDo you spend most of your time trying to save money?\\nHow much time do you spend connecting with new\\nmoney?\\nHow do you act when you see the price of something in\\na store or at a restaurant?\\n\\nThere are no right answers in this test. Rather, my aim is\\nto give you a sense of awareness of how you think about\\nmoney and whether it’s a problem. The key is to be honest with yourself. If you have a\\nproblem with anything in life, the first thing to do is admit it. If you are constantly haunted by money, admit that. Only then\\ncan you switch your scarcity thinking into abundance thinking. Don’t forget: What you are obsessed with will become a\\nreality. If you’re obsessed with money problems, you’ll always\\nhave money problems. If you focus on understanding what\\nmoney means to you, positively, you’ll figure out how to get\\nmore of it. Early in my life my money mantras were phrases like\\n“Money doesn’t grow on trees,” “A penny saved is a penny\\nearned,” “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket,” “Getting rich\\n\\n\\n\\nis greed,” “Wealthy people are unhappy,” and on and on. These all pointed to why I didn’t have financial success. I\\nwould go to dinner and complain about the price of a steak-\\nand-lobster meal that cost $57, go to the movies and complain\\nabout the price of $19 3-D tickets, and then go to the store and\\ncomplain about $9 organic bananas. Fifty-seven dollars is not a lot of money. Neither is $19 or\\n$9. I don’t care what it is for—it just simply is not a lot of\\nmoney in the big picture. No one on this planet just has a $57\\ndollar problem—no one. Why do I say that? Because $57 can’t\\nsolve any problem you or I have without leaving us with\\nanother similar problem soon after. In 2008, after the economy crashed, I woke up big-time\\nabout money. A bank that I had three big real estate loans with\\ndefaulted. I watched the millions of dollars I had accumulated\\nthrough hard work disappear overnight. The fact that a bank defaulted made me realize that\\nanyone who quits paying attention can bust out. I myself had\\nquit being obsessed, backed off on my hustle, and become\\nsatisfied, fat, and lazy. I swore I would never do that again. And I got obsessed with digging my way out. DOMINATE YOUR MONEY THINKING\\n\\nMost of us have been taught that money is the root of all evil\\nand one of the things you do not talk about. In society it seems\\nlike it’s all right to tell people you are broke or middle class,\\nbut get rich and you can’t talk about money anymore. For most people it’s like hearing nails on a chalkboard\\nwhen someone talks about their Rolls-Royce, their jet, and\\ntheir country club. Why? I want to give you permission to talk\\nabout your financial success. Instead of being offended by those who talk about money,\\nyou should avoid those who don’t. And be wary of those who\\ncan’t make money, who spend all their money, or who can’t\\npick up the bill. You can’t learn anything from penny savers\\nand misers who can squeeze a quarter until the eagle cries. Instead of being offended by\\nthose who talk about money,\\nyou should avoid those who\\ndon’t. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nIt’s not true that it takes money to make money. The truth\\nis that it takes courage to make money; 80 percent of all\\nmillionaires today are first-generation millionaires. They\\ndidn’t inherit their money or start with money. You have to be\\ncourageous to connect with new customers, get more attention,\\nand dominate your customers so that they can think of no one\\nelse. Making money, keeping money, and then multiplying\\nmoney requires a monster commitment, dedication, and an\\nobsession with growth. If you work for someone else, take\\nresponsibility for growing the company, not just earning a\\npaycheck. That will stack the deck for both your employer and\\nyou. Don’t be a mere spectator when it comes to making\\nmoney. Be sure you are on the field trying to score. It doesn’t take money to\\nmake money; it takes\\ncourage. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nThere is so much money on this planet it is mind-\\nboggling, yet most people have next to none. Most people\\ndon’t have money because they believe there is a shortage of\\nmoney, or they believe they don’t deserve it or that it’s hard to\\nget. I take the attitude that money is everywhere. Everyone has\\nmoney, and if they are treated right and provided with what\\nthey asked for (and more than that), they will happily give me\\ntheir money. My battle cry is “Who’s got my money?”\\n\\nWhen I was a young salesman and I needed new shoes or\\na new suit, I would show up to work and ask myself, Who’s\\n\\n\\n\\ngot my money for my new suit and shoes? I would look for a\\ncustomer to buy my products or services to get money for the\\nproducts I, in turn, needed. You want revenue? Instead of\\nbeing obsessed with never having enough, focus on how much\\nmoney there is and on getting in front of those people who\\nneed what you’re offering. Money is everywhere and my goal is to get mine. Because\\nof this mind-set, money comes to me easily, effortlessly, and\\nabundantly. I can spend a lot of it and give it away and still\\nhave plenty. My battle cry is “Who’s got\\nmy money?” #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nDOMINATE THE MONEY THINKING OF PEOPLE AROUND YOU\\n\\nAs important as it is to dominate your own money thinking,\\nyou’ll never really get ahead until you get the people around\\nyou to see and treat money the way you do. If your obsession involves building a great organization\\nand not just working by yourself your whole life, you must\\nbecome obsessed with making sure money is a friendly topic\\nin your company. This is true for management, sales, finance\\n—all of it. They need a proper understanding of money that\\nmatches your own. Because face it: If you aren’t influencing\\nthe way your people think about money, someone else is. This is why your presence and the example you set\\nregarding money are key. Your ability to pick up a phone and\\nproduce money is an inspiration. Making great financial\\ndecisions over and over is what winners do, and everyone\\nwants to be on a winning team. You are an example for your\\npeople: Look at the financial condition of those who surround\\nyou to see the results of the example you have set. If you aren’t influencing the\\nway your people think about\\nmoney, someone else is. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nBe obsessed about your people doing well, and you will\\nbecome a giant in their lives. Show a man or a woman how to\\nproduce more money than they ever dreamed while pursuing a\\ngreater purpose, and they will become loyal and dedicated. DOMINATE YOUR AREA OF\\nEXPERTISE\\n\\nBecome an authority on something and get your message out\\nthere. What do you do better than anyone? What are you\\npassionate about? What do you have strong opinions about?\\nWhat is it important for the world to know?\\n\\nA few years ago I realized it really bothered me that there\\nwere guys in the sales industry who were better recognized\\nthan me. It killed me that my name wasn’t up there with the\\nsales greats like Brian Tracy, Tom Hopkins, Og Mandino,\\nNapoleon Hill, and Zig Ziglar. Where was my name on that\\nlist? It irked me that people were interested in their\\ninformation and not reading mine only because they had not\\nheard of me. But that was my fault—I had not been obsessed\\nwith worldwide expansion and had settled for the success I\\nhad achieved. To combat that and to figure out how to become known as\\nan expert the way that they were, I created this exercise. Take a piece of paper. Draw your face in the center of it—\\nthat personalizes the exercise and reminds you who is at the\\ncenter of all of these things. Then draw two columns, one\\n\\n\\n\\nlabeled “professional life” and the other “personal life. ” In\\neach column write down what you have expertise in and what\\ntraits mark you.'}], 'max_tokens': 4096, 'temperature': 0, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}, 'output': {'id': 'chatcmpl-98KchOQPWZEk80OyfHy5hmD8tW9Qm', 'model': 'gpt-4-0125-preview', 'usage': {'total_tokens': 3953, 'prompt_tokens': 3463, 'completion_tokens': 490}, 'object': 'chat.completion', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{\\n  \"summary\": \"The passage discusses the importance of dominating your money thinking, both personally and within your social and professional circles.

But true domination—and\\ntrue obsession—starts with dominating yourself. It might seem easy, but many people never master this\\nconcept: You can’t dominate your business or life—hell, you\\ncan’t even create a corporate or family culture—unless you\\ndominate your own mind-set. You do this by learning to\\ncontrol your thinking, your actions, and your choices. It’s a bad idea to ignore your ambitions, your energy, your\\nobsession, but it’s even worse to let them take their own\\ncourse. They can be like wild horses, running full speed in\\n\\n\\n\\nevery direction, wasting energy and resources with lots of\\neffort that produces nothing. True domination—and true\\nobsession—starts with\\ndominating yourself, not\\nothers. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nDon’t experiment with every idea you, your family, or\\nyour staff have when those ideas have never been tried, tested,\\nor proven. I’m not saying don’t experiment; just experiment\\nwhile you are working full steam on things that you know\\nwork. Why try someone else’s playbook when you have one\\nthat is paying off?\\n\\nConfidence is vital not only to staying on course but also\\nto setting the course, reinforcing that course for everyone, and\\nthen making sure you win. The best way to gain confidence is\\nto dominate your space and everything in it. DOMINATE YOURSELF\\n\\nWhen you neglect to dominate and control yourself, you can\\nwaste years of your life. This is where the military would benefit us all: with its\\nstructure, ethics, rules, orders, and unquestioning task\\nexecution. In civilian life most people don’t operate under a\\nculture or mind-set where you must show up on time, dress in\\na certain way, operate at peak capacity, and follow orders. Because no one is setting a clear course, your energy goes\\neverywhere and nowhere. I have felt the most confused in my life when I had more\\nchoices than I could handle. What I realized is that it is\\nultimately up to you to set rules for yourself. Develop the\\n\\n\\n\\ncapacity to break down and analyze each area of your life so\\nthat you can dominate those that are most important to you. Turn them into vital fuel for your obsessions. DOMINATE YOUR LIMITED THINKING\\n\\nWhen I started my first sales training business, I was the only\\nemployee at first. I wore every hat in the company, from\\naccounting to shipping. My life revolved around finding out\\nwhat worked, repeating that, consolidating the successes and\\nenergy, and repeating again. Even though I was obsessed with work and it was\\nfinancially starting to work for me, I was neurotically and\\nuncontrollably compelled by pain, loss, fear, scarcity, and\\ninsecurity, certain the success would last only so long. I was\\ndriven to work nineteen-hour days not by my purpose but by\\nnecessity as an owner and sole employee. I was being driven\\nby fear. While obsession was working for me in some areas,\\nthe reality was I had not yet given myself full permission to go\\nbig in this space. You don’t want issues beyond your control steering you,\\nbecause you don’t—you can’t—control them. If your\\nproblems own you, it’s only a matter of time before they lead\\nto tormenting destruction. Until you learn how to get rid of the\\nnegative and to focus completely on your potential and your\\ngoals, somehow you will always feel you are falling short. But\\nwhen you define your real obsessions and make them the\\nthings you invest all your time and energy in, everything will\\nstart to change. You will be obsessed by choice, not by pain. Until you figure out how to get rid of all that limited\\nthinking, focus on reining in beliefs or behaviors that harm\\nyou, set you back, or distract you. If you know you’re weak in\\na certain area, move to dominate the problem so that it is no\\nlonger an issue. If alcohol is a problem for you, get it out of\\nthe house. If smoking pot is your vice, flush it down the toilet. If strip joints are not the place where you are going to meet\\nyour mate, knock it off. There is no domination without\\ndiscipline. Rein in the beliefs or\\nbehaviors that harm you, set\\nyou back, or distract you. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nSimilarly, be careful about whom you spend your time\\nwith. The people in your life are either a good influence or a\\nbad influence. There is no gray area. If you don’t know what\\nside they are on, you should not spend time with them. I won’t\\nand don’t. Fill your time up with the ones who are supportive. DOMINATE YOUR TIME\\n\\nPeople constantly ask me, “How do you get everything done?”\\nEasy: I write down the parts of my life that I want to be great\\nin, and then I become obsessed with making time for them\\nrather than making excuses. Case in point: I am committed to making time for my\\nfamily. To pull this off, I have to be smart about it. I get my\\nyoung children up each morning and we go for a drive to the\\nlocal coffee shop, where the three of us hang out together. After fifteen to thirty minutes of quality time, they’re done\\nwith me. When we return home, they eat, and then we all get\\nready for school or the office. Kids don’t need hours of your time; they just need some\\nof your time. By being both committed to spending time with\\nmy kids and creative about how I do that (by hanging out with\\nthem in the mornings instead of at night, for example, or\\ntaking them to the gym with me), I make my time fit my\\nneeds. I don’t manage time—I make time. I don’t manage time—I create\\ntime. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\n\\n\\nBy the way, it’s not just about what the kids need—their\\nparents need time together too. My marriage doesn’t exist in a\\nvacuum, either; running businesses, a marriage, a family, and\\nthe rest of life is a challenge. My wife and I do as much as we\\ncan together at the business; we look for opportunities to work\\ntogether and grow the brand. We take what each of us is good\\nat and then each invest energy in that. I don’t ask her to make\\nsales calls; I let her do what she is good at, which includes\\nproducing projects with Grant Cardone TV and more. One way we optimize time is to spend time together while\\nbuilding the business. For example, we typically don’t go out\\nto dinner just the two of us. Instead we invite employees or\\ncustomers to join us, so we optimize that time too. I don’t see\\na point in spending money on a nice dinner for just the two of\\nus. I’d rather spend four times the amount on a dinner that will\\nproduce more opportunities for us and our business. And\\nhonestly, one date night once or twice a week won’t build a\\nstrong marriage. We have a strong marriage because we’re on\\nthe same page 100 percent of the time, including in how we\\nview time. As I mentioned earlier in the book, blank space in my\\ncalendar leads to boredom, which has gotten me into trouble in\\nthe past. To avoid that, I fill up my time with appointments\\nand activities. Today, at fifty-eight, I literally run from one\\nmeeting to the next. When I fly into a city to do one meeting, I\\nwill stack my calendar with other meetings in that area. Stop wasting time on tasks\\nthat don’t matter. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nAlso, stop wasting time on tasks that don’t matter and\\ndon’t fuel your obsessions. For example, someone else should\\nmow the lawn and wash the car, if those chores don’t get you\\ncloser to your goal. Pay someone else to do tasks that aren’t a\\npart of your obsession. Your time and your focus are precious, so treat them that\\nway. There’s time to do it all—when you make time and quit\\nmanaging it. DOMINATE MONEY\\n\\nMoney is a major area that you absolutely have to dominate. For most people money is a constant concern, whether\\nthey are discussing it or not. Every time they go to the doctor,\\nthey fear the deductible. When they go to the grocery store,\\nthey have to make decisions about what they can and can’t\\nbuy. Every time they get a check they are reminded of the way\\nthey think about money. Most of us are brought up\\npoor or middle class and then\\nleft to live the rest of our lives\\nwith the beliefs of the poor\\nand the middle class. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nBut the lives of people who are barely making it\\nfinancially cannot be fixed by just giving them more money. Most of us are brought up poor or middle class and then left to\\nlive the rest of our lives with the foundations and beliefs of the\\npoor or the middle class. We emerge full of doubt and\\nconfused about our finances, because we grew up with\\noverwhelmed parents, clueless teachers, and an irresponsible\\ngovernment. Still, even if we are dazed, confused, apathetic,\\nand even resentful about money, each of us can work to\\novercome the money mentality we inherited.

Haters are going to hate,\\nwhile the obsessed are going\\nto create. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nI have had many haters in my life—and I am convinced I\\nwould not be where I am today without them. All of them have\\ncontributed to my success. Here are just a few:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe football players who beat me up in high school\\nThe manager of McDonald’s who fired me when I was\\nfifteen\\nThe counselor who told me I would never stay clean\\nThe sales manager who tried repeatedly to fire me early\\nin my sales career\\nThe two banks that refused to give me loans on my first\\nreal estate deals because I had no experience\\nCompetitors in my speaking career who were threatened\\nby my presence and made up lies about me if I won a\\ncustomer’s business\\nThe PR company in Los Angeles that told me I was\\noverexposed and should take all my videos off the\\nInternet\\nThe social media gurus who said I was too self-\\npromotional\\nThe publishers who turned down my first book\\n\\nHaters are always saying more about themselves than they\\nare saying about the person they are hating on. “He is so\\ncocky, showing off on his Gulfstream!” really means “Why\\ndon’t I have a jet?” “He talks about money all the time!”\\nmeans “I’m trying to make sense of why my money isn’t\\nright. ” “He promotes himself so much” means “I don’t\\npromote myself enough. ” When they hate on me, they’re\\ntrying to make sense of why they quit. If you don’t have haters, you are not obsessed. If you\\ndon’t collect haters, you are doing nothing. If you don’t have\\nhaters, you are a threat to no one. A guaranteed indication that\\nyou are onto something and making things happens is getting\\nand having haters. Your job is not to get along with haters. You don’t need to\\nget rid of them or handle them. Your job is to stay obsessed\\nwith your obsessions until they are realized, and then obsess\\nsome more. HATERS ARE ACTUALLY YOUR BEST PROMOTERS\\n\\n\\n\\nI don’t like people saying nasty, spiteful, untrue things about\\nme, but because I know that it’s part of being successful, I\\nhave come to embrace my haters. They promote me for free at\\nthe expense of their time and energy. And remember, when\\nhaters are hating, they aren’t creating anything . except\\nmore for those they hate on. When haters are hating, they\\naren’t creating. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nWhen people hate on me in public, they are promoting\\nme, my name, and my brand. Please write about me. Tell the\\nworld why you disagree with me. Tell the world why I’m\\nawful. Because love me or hate me, at least you know me. Haters will promote you when naysayers won’t. Naysayers won’t tell the world how crazy your ideas are,\\nbecause they are worried for you and trying to protect you. But\\nhaters will tell the world about you, your ideas, and how crazy\\nyou are. Haters will promote you more than even your biggest\\nfans. When they publicly lose their minds because you are\\nmaking the impossible possible, when they seek to take you\\ndown through some form of media, they are promoting you all\\nthe more. In fact, the more successful I am, the more the haters\\nscream about me. I always tell people, “If I could get half of\\nthe people in the United States to hate me, I could be the\\npresident!”\\n\\nHaters will promote you more\\nthan even your biggest fans. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nTurn haters’ negativity into fuel for your obsession. Don’t\\ntry to stomp them out. HATERS GIVE YOU GREAT IDEAS\\n\\nUse the negative energy haters provide you to fuel something\\ncreative. Someone once wrote an awful, nasty blog post that\\nclaimed I was completely selfish because I waited until fifty-\\none to have children. Not only was that the most insane thing I\\nhad ever heard, the truth was that I waited until fifty-one\\nbecause my wife didn’t get pregnant until then, though we had\\nbeen trying. My response was not to block this person, retaliate,\\ndebate, or defend myself. Instead I was inspired to create The\\nG&E Show with my wife. Each week we sit in front of\\ncameras talking about the challenges of marriage, kids, and\\nbusiness. Let your haters help you be a creator!\\n\\nHATERS TELL YOU THAT YOU’RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK\\n\\nWhen social media hit the scene in a big way, there were a\\nnumber of social media conventions. Two presenters used my\\nname and my posting habits as their example of what not to do\\non social media. My response was not to attack them back or\\nto have a debate. I simply concluded that their hating on me\\nwas an indication that I was doing the right thing. I figured\\nthat if they were talking about me for doing what I had done so\\nfar, if I did 10X more, then their complaints would at least\\ncontinue to promote me. Over time, though they didn’t promote me, evidence\\nshowed they were wrong. My audience online grew 200\\npercent, and today my company is on track to have our posts,\\nvideos, and blogs seen by 200 million people. Those\\n“authorities” who thought they knew everything? I left them in\\nthe dust. STARVE THE DOUBTERS AND STAY\\nON TRACK\\n\\nThe real danger haters and naysayers bring is the possibility of\\ngoing off track. If you do not push through all the doubts and\\nconfusion they throw at you, you will lose. You must be willing to cross the safety line in life and in\\nbusiness. Governors are put on engines to keep things running\\nnice and steady, so that the engines don’t go too fast and blow\\nup. But the obsessed are willing to redline the engine, and that\\nscares the general public. The obsessed are not interested in popularity contests or\\nany majority-rules approach. The obsessed are monster\\ndreamers who are confused by the fact that so many people\\nthink so small. They don’t understand when it became popular\\nto not dream big and would rather be disappointed by not\\nreaching a massive target than never try to reach it at all. Haters and naysayers don’t reach; they just talk. The obsessed aren’t\\ncommitted to popularity,\\nthey’re committed to success. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nNo one creates an explosive business or the next big thing\\nby staying inside the lines of what people expect of them. The\\nnaysayers will warn you and the haters will scream. Let them. Sure, you know that your goals will irritate the average people\\nwho love you and drive the quitters insane. Telling the\\nnaysayers you’re no longer listening to them is no easy task. But you have to get so comfortable with and sure of your\\nobsession that you don’t listen to anyone who tells you it’s\\nbetter to doubt and be confused. Use the naysayers as guides and the haters as fuel. Do not\\nfight them, and certainly never attempt to tame your\\nobsessions. Obsessed people aren’t looking for permission or\\napproval. They don’t need anyone to tell them that their ideas\\nsound “okay. ” Instead, their inner resolve makes them solidify\\nspace, explode ideas, and trespass boundaries. They create\\nnew environments because they invade conventional reality,\\nentering with neither permission nor approval and exiting\\nhaving redefined everything. Success is the ultimate revenge against the haters, critics,\\nand naysayers. I know this is extremely immature on my part,\\nbut I love knowing that all the people who have done me\\nwrong or counted me out can see me flying private, read about\\nme in a magazine, open Twitter or Facebook or Periscope and\\nsee me reposted and liked, or walk through an airport and see\\nmy books in the bookstore window. I just can’t wait until they\\ndo a movie about me and I am on the sides of buildings and\\nbuses!\\n\\nMassive success is the\\nultimate revenge. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\n\\n\\nY\\n\\nCHAPTER 6\\n\\nDOMINATE TO WIN\\n\\nou can have boundless energy, an intense, white-hot\\ndrive, and dreams so big they wake you up in a sweat\\nevery night, but if you don’t dominate all areas of\\n\\nyour life, you will collapse under the many forms destructive\\nforces take.

Given a piece of text, chapterize and generate a JSON format as output. Follow the instructions below to help you in generating the output:\\n\\n1. **Understand the Key-Value Structure:**\\n   - A key-value pair consists of:\\n      - `\\'summary\\'`: A top-level overview or description of the chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'headers\\'`: A list of headers where a header is a line of text that introduces a new section or chapter in a document. It is typically formatted distinctly from the main body text to stand out, often being bolder, in a larger font, or differently styled. Headers are concise, summarizing the content that follows, and they guide the reader through the document\\'s structure. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'subheaders\\'`: A list of subheaders where subheaders are similar to headers but usually introduce subsections within a larger section. They are often formatted to be slightly less prominent than main headers, but still distinct from the body text. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'named_entities\\'`: A list of dictionary of named entities identified in the text. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'keypoints\\'`: A list of the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given text chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'tonality\\'`: The overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n\\n2. **Extract Relevant Information:**\\n   - Focus on extracting the most relevant information or identification from each chunk. This could include key themes, essential concepts, or significant details.\\n\\n3. **Perform Named Entity Recognition:**\\n   - Extract named entities from a given text and organize the results, providing the option for individual descriptions for each entity. \\n   - As part of the information extraction, identify and categorize any named entities, including but not limited to PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, etc., within the text.\\n   - The system should present the extracted entities in a structured format, allowing for detailed descriptions or additional information for each identified entity.  \\n   - Follow exactly the example below for the named entities:\\n\\n      named_entities = [\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_1>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_1>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1a>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_2>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1b>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with individual descriptions as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_2>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_3>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_4>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with a common description as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         # Add more entries as needed\\n      ]\\n   \\n   <Tag_1> and <Tag_2> represent different types of named entities.\\n   Each tag contains a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an entity and its associated description.\\n   Each entity can have an individual description.\\n\\n\\n4. **Determine the Tonality:**\\n   - Assess the overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Include this assessment under the key `\\'tonality\\'`.\\n\\n5. **Highlight the Keypoints:**\\n   - Identify and list the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given chunk under the key `\\'keypoints\\'`.\\n\\n6. **Header Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical to headers of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Look for any title case or all uppercase.\\n      - Position: Consider if any text is at the beginning of a section or stands alone.\\n      - Content: Assess if the text is concise and focused.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Note any numbering or special symbols.\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if any text introduces a new topic or section.\\n\\n7. **Subheader Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical of subheaders of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Subheaders often follow title case, but they might not always be in all uppercase, unlike some main headers.\\n      - Position: Check if the text appears within a section, usually following a main header. Subheaders are often used to introduce subtopics within a larger section.\\n      - Content: Determine if the text is more specific than a main header but still concise. It should elaborate on the content introduced by the main header.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Look for secondary or nested numbering or bullet points (e.g., \"1.1 Subsection\", \"• Subpoint\").\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if the text refines or narrows down the topic introduced by the main header, rather than introducing a completely new topic.\\n\\n8. **Generate Tags**\\n   - Please generate tags based on the given relevant information and strictly refrain from generating empty tags or empty array.\\n\\n9. **Provide Clear Details:**\\n   - Clearly present the information extracted from the piece of text. Ensure that the details are concise and informative.\\n\\n10. **Strict JSON Response:**\\n   - Strictly format your response as a JSON object.

Here are some examples:\\n\\nI went to Mom early in my career, saying, “Mom, I am\\ngoing to quit my job and start my own business. ” She\\nsaid, “But you are doing so well! Why would you do\\nthat right now?”\\n“Hey, Mom,” I said, “I am going to start a second\\ncompany with a partner. ” She replied, “You know, your\\ndad had his company taken away from him when he\\ntook on partners. ”\\nOne day I announced, “I’m starting to invest in real\\nestate,” and she said, “How are you going to handle\\ntenants calling you at midnight about a plumbing leak?”\\nWhen I told her I was going to fulfill my lifelong dream\\nof living in California, automatically she said, “I can’t\\neven believe you are thinking about that! It’s so\\n\\n\\n\\nexpensive to live there and everyone who lives there is\\ncrazy. ”\\n\\nMy mother never started her own business, never took on\\na partner, never invested in real estate, and had only once been\\nto California—but she had warnings about all of these things I\\nwanted to do. Without even realizing what she was doing, my mom\\nautomatically responded to all my ideas with caution. She\\nwanted me to play it safe, which is ultimately the reason why\\nthe people who love you will tend to say no to your ideas. They are concerned about you first, and their instinct is to\\nprotect you and themselves. That is why most of the advice\\nyou receive will not be supportive—it is aimed at preventing\\nyou from doing anything that involves risk. Recently I told my sister about a real estate venture I was\\nconsidering, and she immediately reminded me of the one\\ntime, long, long ago when I ventured into a partnership and it\\ndidn’t work out. Why would she feel the need to remind me of\\nthe one time things didn’t work out? You think it’s possible to\\nbe in business for thirty-five years and not have one thing go\\nwrong? But she does not have the long view, the confident\\nview. She has the play-it-safe view. She was being a protector\\n—a sister, not a creator—and doesn’t know how obsessed with\\nmy obsessions I am or how happy they make me. She was\\nresponding as family, not thinking like an entrepreneur. The best way to handle\\nnaysayers is to hit your goals\\nover and over until they have\\nno choice but to believe in\\nyou. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nWe have the kind of relationships where I simply told her\\nto knock it off. “I don’t need or want your doubt. I want your\\n\\n\\n\\nsupport!” I said. “And by the way, I love you. ”\\n\\nIn general, though, the best way to handle naysayers is to\\nhit your goals over and over until they have no choice but to\\nbelieve in you. PROFESSIONAL WORRIERS\\n\\nI was having a medical checkup recently, and as the doctor\\nstarted to check my blood pressure, she launched into a\\nlecture: “You know, people like you tend to be under a lot of\\nstress. You really should . ” But I had already quit listening\\nto her. I have had heard this so many times from so many people. People are always telling me how stressful my life must be\\nwho, in truth, have no clue whether I am experiencing stress or\\nnot. I’m not experiencing stress; I’m loving my life. I love and\\ncrave all the activity and all the crazy new challenges. What these professional worriers are really saying is that\\nthey think they would get stressed out if they were doing all\\nthat I do. They’re saying more about themselves than about\\nme. I’ll tell you, that doctor was the one who looked stressed,\\ntired, beat up, and hammered. UNSOLICITED AND UNTESTED ADVICE GIVERS\\n\\nUnsolicited advice givers are people who know about\\neverything but have never done anything. Regardless of their\\nintentions, the advice they offer inflicts doubt upon you:\\n\\n“Can’t you just be happy?”\\n“When are you going to have enough?”\\n“That’s great, but you know, we love you just the way\\nyou are. ”\\n“Don’t you have enough Twitter followers to get your\\nmessage out?”\\n\\nI have had to listen to unsolicited advice and useless yet\\npopular little sayings from countless people my entire life. Who are these people talking to, anyway? Are they trying to\\nconvince me or are they convincing themselves that having\\nless is better? Whether the advice comes from family or\\nbusiness “experts” you hired to help you, take it with a grain\\nof salt, because if you take it seriously, you will feel the sting\\nof doubt. When social media arrived, I knew it was monster big,\\nand I also knew I was obsessed with getting known\\neverywhere. I started posting and then I was told repeatedly\\nthat I was posting way too much. “Experts” advised me to post\\nless. Who makes these rules? And where is it written that I can\\npost only so much? Where do people get their data? I wanted\\nto know who was saying that, how many followers they had,\\nand how much they interacted on the platforms. My brother told me, “Dude, you post too much. ” I replied,\\n“Delete me—the page isn’t for you; it’s for the seven billion\\npeople who don’t know me. ” Every time someone on my staff\\nsaid, “You are posting too much. People are complaining,” I\\nthought to myself, CNN throws up on America 24-7, 365 days\\na year. And when people get sick of them, they move over to\\nFox or another channel that spews terrifying information\\naround the clock. Then they turn on Netflix, where they can get\\na million years of mostly garbage content. My conclusion was\\nthat if you have great content and are giving people great\\ninformation, you can post every fifteen seconds if you want. Sometimes we post something new on Twitter every five\\nminutes. Does that seem excessive? You only say yes because\\nyou don’t understand the size of the universe of social media. According to Excelacom, in one Internet minute in 2016 there\\nare 2. 78 million video views on YouTube, 2. 4 million searches\\non Google, 31,194 Instagram posts, and 347,222 tweets . not to mention everything else shared on all the other\\nplatforms. If I lose followers because I post too much, I assume they\\nwere never going to do business with me anyway. If a person\\ngoes away because I push too hard, call too much, or send too\\nmany e-mails, then it’s likely they’re not the type of person I\\n\\n\\n\\nwant to do business with—and not the type of person who\\nunderstands what it means to be obsessed. Someone told me at a speech in Austin, “Grant, you post\\ntoo much. I had to block you. ” I replied, “Love me or hate me,\\nat least now you know me. ” What’s most interesting is this\\nguy who had blocked me was now paying to come see me in\\nperson. If a prospect goes away\\nbecause I push too hard, call\\ntoo much, or send too many\\ne-mails, then it’s likely they’re\\nnot the type of person I want\\nto do business with. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nPEOPLE JUSTIFYING THEIR AVERAGENESS\\n\\nUnderstand that naysayers are trying to protect themselves\\nfrom being reminded that they have relegated themselves to an\\naverage life. They cannot afford for you to do something big\\nbecause it will challenge the justifications they made for their\\nown decisions. You are a threat to all things average. You\\nremind the average that they have settled!\\n\\nI can’t tell you how many times I’ve told someone I’m\\nwriting a book and their response is “You know, it’s a lot of\\nwork to write a book” or “People don’t read books anymore”\\nor “Did you know that most books never get published?”\\n\\nThis is the voice of the naysayer who needs to make sense\\nof not doing, who needs to defend their right to be average. They’ve never written that book they’ve always wanted to\\nwrite!\\n\\nIt doesn’t matter whether their intention is to help you or\\nhurt you. If you listen to them, the result is the same: They will\\ndeter you and add doubt and confusion to your already-\\n\\n\\n\\nchallenging goals, making a difficult activity a thousand times\\nmore difficult. THE HATERS\\n\\nThe naysayers I described above are people who are\\nsupposedly on your side, not intentionally trying to stop you. Their negativity can often be overcome by simply\\nunderstanding why they say what they say. But there are those out there who are truly envious and\\nbitter and threatened by anyone who is successful. These\\npeople produce nothing themselves; they only try to stop those\\nwho do produce. What separates the haters from the naysayers is the\\nintention behind their negativity. The naysayer may be\\nsomeone close to you who actually wants the best for you. The\\nhaters, on the other hand, don’t want you to succeed; they\\nwant you to fail. The haters are much easier to identify and understand\\nbecause they really don’t want the best for you.

Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'tonality\\'`: The overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n\\n2. **Extract Relevant Information:**\\n   - Focus on extracting the most relevant information or identification from each chunk. This could include key themes, essential concepts, or significant details.\\n\\n3. **Perform Named Entity Recognition:**\\n   - Extract named entities from a given text and organize the results, providing the option for individual descriptions for each entity. \\n   - As part of the information extraction, identify and categorize any named entities, including but not limited to PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, etc., within the text.\\n   - The system should present the extracted entities in a structured format, allowing for detailed descriptions or additional information for each identified entity.  \\n   - Follow exactly the example below for the named entities:\\n\\n      named_entities = [\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_1>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_1>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1a>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_2>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1b>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with individual descriptions as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_2>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_3>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_4>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with a common description as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         # Add more entries as needed\\n      ]\\n   \\n   <Tag_1> and <Tag_2> represent different types of named entities.\\n   Each tag contains a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an entity and its associated description.\\n   Each entity can have an individual description.\\n\\n\\n4. **Determine the Tonality:**\\n   - Assess the overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed.

Subheaders are often used to introduce subtopics within a larger section.\\n      - Content: Determine if the text is more specific than a main header but still concise. It should elaborate on the content introduced by the main header.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Look for secondary or nested numbering or bullet points (e.g., \"1.1 Subsection\", \"• Subpoint\").\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if the text refines or narrows down the topic introduced by the main header, rather than introducing a completely new topic.\\n\\n8. **Generate Tags**\\n   - Please generate tags based on the given relevant information and strictly refrain from generating empty tags or empty array.\\n\\n9. **Provide Clear Details:**\\n   - Clearly present the information extracted from the piece of text.

I\\nbought a house in Houston; I got a girlfriend. I spent $2,000\\non a new computer. I would go to my little executive office\\n\\n\\n\\nand spend all day planning, organizing, writing, and learning\\nhow to use my new computer. I took my time. When I say “took my time,” I mean that one year went by\\nand I hadn’t even started doing any real work. One day I called\\nmy brother Gary at work to see how he was doing. “Grant,” he\\nsaid, “quit calling me at work during the week. I have a\\nbusiness to run. When are you going to start calling on clients\\nand building your business?”\\n\\nThat cut me deep, because it was the truth. I had traded in\\nthe obsession I thought I was chasing for hanging out with\\n“friends” for movies, soccer, softball, and weekend barbecues,\\nand too much introspection. Hell, I had spent all this time\\nlearning how to use the customer-information filing system on\\nmy computer—and didn’t have any customers to put into the\\ndata file! When my brother laid into me, it broke through and\\ngave me the inspiration I needed to put my head down and go\\ninto complete immersion and total obsession with my new\\ncompany. The following Monday I was on a plane to\\nAlbuquerque, ready to recommit to my plan. I am not happy unless I am working. That doesn’t make\\nme defective. It makes me productive. I am simply happiest\\nwhen I am most productive. You might be too, regardless of\\nwhat others say. They don’t know what you want. Don’t let\\nsomeone else tell you how you should feel about your\\nobsession with success. And quit apologizing to or making\\nsense of those who proudly brag, “I don’t want it all. ”\\n\\nI am not happy unless I am\\nworking. That doesn’t make\\nme defective. It makes me\\nproductive. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nTHE MYTH OF BALANCE\\n\\n\\n\\nThe whole concept of having balance in your life is ridiculous. I am not trying to balance my life—I am trying to blow it up. People often think if they become completely obsessed in\\norder to be great and dominate, something must be\\ncompromised, be it time with their family, a good gym\\nschedule, hobbies, going to church, reading books, or\\nwhatever. Wrong! Obsession isn’t about settling or sacrificing things\\nthat are important to you. Obsession is about having it all:\\nhealth, faith, family, career, money. You don’t need to ask,\\nWhat would I rather have, money or health? “Both” is the\\nonly answer. Obsession isn’t about settling\\nor sacrificing things that are\\nimportant to you, it’s about\\nhaving it all. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nYou don’t need to choose between this and that, between\\nsuccess and a good life. That’s for average people who have\\nlost control of their futures. Obsessed people demand it all and\\nget it all. They’re not preoccupied with “balance. ”\\n\\nTake advice from those who have figured out how to do it\\nall, not just part of it—and definitely not from those who have\\nquit on the dream. The people who suggest you live your life\\nby making trade-offs and seeking balance don’t know anything\\nabout achieving extraordinary lives. They aren’t trying to build\\nlegacies or change the world, and they proudly admit to\\nwhoever will listen, “I don’t need all that,” “I am happy with a\\nnormal life,” or “I just want to be happy. ”\\n\\nI don’t even believe these people know what they are\\ntalking about because, to me, they are not “balanced”—they\\nare half alive. HATERS AND NAYSAYERS\\n\\nIf you are going to see your obsessions all the way through,\\nyou must be ready to deal with those who are going to be\\ncritical, envious, and worse—those who drive doubt. I like to\\ncall them “haters and naysayers. ” You’ll be surrounded by\\nboth if you want to be successful. In fact, the more successful\\nyou become, the more haters and naysayers you’ll attract. I assure you that when you make it public that you are\\ngoing all in on your obsessions, the haters and naysayers will\\ncome out of the woodwork with unsolicited opinions about\\nhow wrong and ridiculous that is. Their doubt, fear, jealousy,\\nand advice to quit will come at you from every direction. Hell,\\nyou are likely to have a couple show themselves if they see\\nyou reading this book. The world is filled with people\\nwho have given up on their\\ndreams and now spend their\\nlives trying to get others to\\ngive up on theirs. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nYou must make sure you aren’t one of the many haters and\\nnaysayers. You have to handle any self-doubt you have going\\non inside you. Get ahead of that self-talk with this exercise,\\nwhich focuses you on your massive goals. I have huge, crazy ideas. They are so out there that even\\nthe obsessed think they’re over the top. If they’re crazy to me,\\nwhat might the average person think or say when they hear of\\nthese ideas?\\n\\nSeven billion people will know my name. I am going public with a $4 billion+ real estate fund. I am producing a hit television show. I am running for president in 2020. Now it’s your turn. Make a list of some of your crazy\\ngoals—or better yet, grab the goals you’ve already started\\nwriting down from the exercise in chapter 3. When you were reading these goals, did you hear that\\nvoice in your mind saying, No way? It will start offering a\\nrunning commentary about how impractical, ridiculous, and\\nimpossible your ideas are. That voice will say things like:\\n\\nWhere are you going to find time to do this?\\nWhat are you doing this for?\\nYou are too old for this or You are too young for this. Notice how even you have an internal critic putting you\\ndown, discouraging you, and making you miserable—and you\\nare supposed to be on your side!\\n\\nWhat can you say to you? When I doubt whether I can, for\\nexample, build a $4 billion real estate empire, I quickly take\\nout a pencil and write down the number $4,000,000,000. Then\\nI think about how close I am to this goal and write that down\\n($400 million, where I am at this time). I also think about who\\nelse has done it and how many times has it been done. With\\nthat, I am immediately back on track with the possibility of my\\ngoals rather than the doubts I have about them. Get out of your\\nhead and onto paper, and focus on how you can rather than\\nhow you can’t. There are plenty of naysayers and haters. I can’t afford to\\nbe one of them and neither can you. There are plenty of naysayers\\nand haters. I can’t afford to be\\none of them and neither can\\n\\n\\n\\nyou. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nOnce you get your head straight on not being your own\\nobstacle, how do you recognize and eliminate the other\\nsources of doubt in your life?\\n\\nTHE NAYSAYERS\\n\\nIt would be one thing if critics were just evil, mean people\\nwho meant nothing to you, but sadly they also include people\\nwho love and care for you. And while the naysayers’ intent is\\nnot necessarily to cause you harm, their comments can stop\\nyou, at least for a moment. It would be one thing if critics\\nwere just evil people who\\nmeant nothing to you. But\\nthey also include people who\\nlove and care for you. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nWho might launch a surprise attack? Surprising people: a\\nparent, sibling, lover, spouse, child, best friend, employee,\\nemployer, manager, coworker, stranger, board member,\\nteacher, investor, even guru or life coach. PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU AND WANT YOU TO PLAY IT SAFE\\n\\nThe naysayers all sound the same. Any of these sound\\nfamiliar?\\n\\n“Be careful. ”\\n“Watch yourself. ”\\n“Be patient. ”\\n“Go slow. ”\\n“Why take the risk?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Play it safe. ”\\n“You don’t need to do that. ”\\n“We love you just the way you are. ”\\n\\nAnd on and on. They care about you—but that doesn’t\\nmean they have the right to distract you from your destiny. My mom was my best friend and one of my biggest fans. She was also my biggest naysayer—after all, she was a mother\\nand protector. “Be careful,” she would say, or “Can’t you just\\nbe satisfied with what you have done?” “Why do you need so\\nmuch?” She believed in me and even so, she was a naysayer. Even in her own life, her first response to almost everything\\nwas always “no,” and it had been for years. I always wanted to impress my mother. Even as a fifty-\\nyear-old adult with multiple businesses who had proven\\nhimself in the world, my first inclination was to share new\\nideas and successes with my mom. And every time, without\\nexception, her response was that of a naysayer.

The leaders of\\nthe groups had marriages that were falling apart, and they were\\nstruggling with finances. They were obsessed with their\\nproblems, while I was obsessed with success. It took me a long\\ntime to wake up to this, but eventually I realized you don’t fix\\nproblems with problems—you fix them with success. Today I let myself absorb advice and help only from\\npeople who are doing better than me. I believe in the saying\\n\\n\\n\\n“If you are the most successful person in the room, you are in\\nthe wrong room. ”\\n\\nI live by the saying “If you are\\nthe most successful person in\\nthe room, you are in the\\nwrong room. ” #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nHaven’t you tried “self-development” their way long\\nenough? Stop looking at where you’ve been and what\\nhappened to you. Make it clear to everyone you are done with\\nassigning blame and with the kind of self-discovery that leaves\\nyou powerless. Remind them not to fight your genius but to\\nget behind it. Encourage people to see what you see, sell them\\non the concept, convince them it’s better, or demand that they\\nget behind and away from you. Yes, you are fanatical, and yes, the mission is impossible,\\nand yes, you know no one has ever done exactly what you\\nwant to do before. But none of those conditions are cause for\\ndoubt! Respond with determination and go all in. DOUBT AND BLAME ARE DEAD TO\\nYOU\\n\\nMake it known to all who need to know—family, friends,\\nemployers, employees—that you are prepared to go all in on\\nyour obsessions. Tell them, “I am addicted to, obsessed with,\\nand committed to my future, regardless of my past. ” Let them\\nsee that you have removed your foot from the brake and are\\nstepping only on the accelerator. Make it clear that you will\\nnot tolerate doubt from anyone around you either, that you\\nhave no time for blame, and that you expect complete and total\\nsupport to move forward with life. Doubt will be treated like\\nan enemy. I am obsessed with my future,\\nregardless of my past. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nIn your office make it clear that you will no longer tolerate\\nothers doubting your vision or blaming anyone or anything for\\ntheir own coming up short. Let everyone know you aren’t\\nwishing for success but demanding success at levels that you\\nall previously thought impossible and you expect everyone\\nelse to support, comply, and make that a reality. “Oh my gosh,” you say, “this is going to create havoc and\\nturmoil. My family and my employees can’t handle all these\\n‘obsessed’ changes at one time. There is going to be dissent,\\nupheaval, and confusion. ”\\n\\nBut all that is better than doubt! These things you are so\\nworried about are already happening—and worse, you are\\nattaining the low-level success you deserve. Doubt has kept\\nyou from getting where you want to go. It has left you without\\na purpose or an obsession. This very lack of clarity is what has\\nallowed the doubts to take hold. BEWARE OF WHERE DOUBT\\nGROWS\\n\\nDoubt grows in areas of our life where we think we’re taking\\ncare of ourselves. I know because I’ve been there, done that,\\nand suffered for it. I’ve tried the conventional wisdom, and I\\nknow it isn’t a good idea for me to avoid burnout like the\\nplague, to take lengthy vacations, and to always seek balance\\nin life. My experience in life has turned all these notions on\\ntheir heads. THE MYTH OF BURNOUT\\n\\n\\n\\nIn my late thirties I was living in La Jolla, California, and\\nrunning a seminar business that was delivering sixteen eight-\\nhour seminars per month in different cities in America. On\\nMartin Luther King Day, Presidents’ Day, Memorial Day, and\\nThanksgiving, when U. S. offices were closed, I delivered\\nseminars in Canada, where offices were open. Whenever I\\nwasn’t in front of an audience all day long, I worked on my\\nconsulting business. My calendar was slammed. I didn’t even\\nknow what city I was in some days. Just prior to my fortieth birthday, I started experiencing\\nwhat others described as burnout. I was losing my luster: I was\\ntired, irritable, angry, and I was becoming demanding like\\nthose divas you hear about. I didn’t like the way I was acting. I\\nsaw a nutritionist and tried meditation. People were telling me\\nI was looking tired, that I was working too hard and that my\\nlife was out of balance. I had heard it all before, but this time I\\nbought what everyone was telling me and I started telling\\nmyself the same. I decided to take a hard look at my current situation to see\\nwhat I had to do to get myself back to being obsessed and in\\nlove with what I was doing rather than feeling burned out. It\\ndidn’t make sense to me that I could simply be tired because I\\nwas working and traveling too much. This was the easiest job I\\nhad done in my life. I was standing up and talking to hundreds\\nof professional salespeople about how to grow their sales! I\\nwas young, had plenty of energy, and didn’t mind working\\nhard. I sat down with a piece of paper and took an inventory of\\nmy life. What is my purpose in life and what am I currently\\ndoing? I asked myself. If I get back to my purpose and clarify\\nmy goals, I thought, I will get back on track. As I wrote, it hit me, just as the truth always does,\\nimmediately and clearly. I had lost track of my bigger purpose;\\nI was no longer obsessed with the big goals and had settled for\\nsimply being busy and having some modest financial success. None of this was in any way in line with what I knew I was\\ncapable of. The “burnout” had started because I was no longer\\nobsessed with fulfilling my monster purpose and continuing to\\nbuild on what I was doing. The seminars had become\\nrepetitive. I was a public speaker with a rote delivery: same\\nthing, different audience. But my purpose had never been to\\njust travel around talking to audiences and collecting money. Yet somehow I had gone from a someone with a dream of\\nbeing a serious businessman to just another speaker. Once I realized this, I started to ask myself, What do I\\nneed to be doing to be obsessed with what I am doing again? I\\nhad been fascinated with the idea of creating a new way of\\nselling that would change the world, not just change one\\nindustry (at this time I was speaking to just the auto industry). I also reminded myself I had always wanted to have a big real\\nestate company. I decided I would split up my company. I’d create a\\nconsulting company for the auto industry, expand the brand of\\nmy speaking career to serve other verticals, and step hard into\\nmy real estate business. As it turns out, I wasn’t burned out after all. Once I\\nreaffirmed my purpose, I immediately felt rejuvenated and\\nexcited. I quit asking average people for advice, quit\\nquestioning myself, and went full bore toward my purpose. I\\nrefocused on my obsession with fulfilling my complete\\npotential, not just being financially successful. Now the challenge was to make this obsession public and\\nacquire help to get me there. In a couple of months I had a\\npromotional company promoting my seminars, a partner\\npicking up the automotive sector, and a sweat equity partner to\\nhelp me acquire and manage the real estate. Soon I found\\nmyself back on track and moving faster than ever. When you are clear on your purpose, you will never burn\\nout. THE MYTH OF TIME OFF AND VACATIONS\\n\\n\\n\\nI know it’s popular to think you need a vacation, time off work\\nto relax and unplug. In reality, though, most people aren’t in a\\nposition to take a vacation long enough to really unwind\\nanyway. And while a vacation can feel like a relief, the point\\nof getting away is to rejuvenate not just the body but also the\\npurpose. I believe that when you are full-tilt obsessed with\\nachieving your full potential and making a monster\\ncontribution to the world, you will naturally regenerate and\\ncreate energy. I know I’ve been on vacations that took more\\nenergy than work itself. How much golf can you really play?\\nHow much time can you spend in the sun?\\n\\nPeople are vacation starved because they believe “time\\noff” is going to renew them. The only thing that is going to\\nultimately renew you is getting reobsessed with your purpose. This is why so many successful people do not see work as\\nwork. The only thing that is going to\\nultimately renew you is\\ngetting obsessed with your\\npurpose. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nI also think free time is one of the bigger threats to your\\nsuccess. I have a saying: “If you want to meet the devil, have\\nwhite space on your calendar. ”\\n\\nTaking time off early in my entrepreneurial career almost\\nderailed my life. When I had steeled my determination to go\\nout on my own, I made the mistake of, once again, listening to\\nfriends who said I’d been working too hard. They said that a\\nbreak would be good for me.

In this case the asset\\nwas in my head: all of my sales knowledge. I took three hours,\\nthe words spilled out of me, and I wrote a book that started a\\nmovement. I took this product to the market and people\\nexchanged money for my knowledge of how to make sales in a\\nmarket where people were cutting back. When Borders closed\\ntheir doors, I was selling books door to door and growing my\\nbusiness and my brand. I was creating money while they sat\\n\\n\\n\\naround obsessed with the past, blaming technology and the\\neconomy for their demise. Get obsessed with your financial success and getting your\\nmoney right—or be punished. FEED THE BEAST WITH GREAT\\nPEOPLE\\n\\nIf you’re really obsessed with feeding the beast and being\\nsuccessful, it’s important to surround yourself with great\\npeople who respect and understand this. If you’re really obsessed with\\nsuccess you must surround\\nyourself with others obsessed\\nwith success. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nIn all five companies I own, I have created cultures of\\nsuccess focused on feeding the beast together. We do this with\\nlots of urgency and deadlines, becoming single-mindedly\\nfocused for short periods of time, ignoring all but our\\nsuccesses. We become obsessed with projects. There is no\\ntolerance for counterorders, alternative ideas, watered-down\\nversions, “yeah buts,” or introduction of new themes. When an order is given to do something, it needs to be\\ncrystal clear, simple, measurable, and achievable, and then\\nexecutives should reinforce it until it is fully executed and\\nresults are achieved. Every order should come with a target\\nand a deadline. The more important this target is, the more\\noften you should get a report on it. The first time I asked for hourly reports on the sales a\\ndepartment had made, I had to repeat my request for days\\nbecause it was so unreal to the team leader that anyone would\\n\\n\\n\\ncheck something every hour. But I wanted the reports so I\\ncould tweak the program and ensure we succeeded. If that\\nmeant getting a report on our sales every single hour, that’s\\nwhat I would have to do. MEET WITH YOUR TEAM EVERY DAY\\n\\nAnything worth doing is worth doing every day. If you don’t\\nmeet as a team every day, your team will soon devolve into a\\nbunch of people going in different directions. Over time you\\nwill not maximize the success you deserve, and you will fail\\nbecause of lack of confidence and lack of activity. Anything worth doing is worth\\ndoing every day. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nThis is especially true in sales. Sales gets a bad reputation\\nbecause it’s filled with uncommitted amateurs who are never\\nheld accountable, aren’t properly motivated, and are\\ninsufficiently trained. Your daily sales meeting reinforces who\\nyou are, what you do, what you want from your team, what\\nyou expect from them, and what you provide your customers. All these things feed the beast. ENCOURAGE THROUGH ATTENTION\\n\\nEither you or your manager needs to walk into your sales\\noffice every hour to make sure that the team members aren’t\\noff doing their own thing again. I don’t care if you simply\\nwalk through the room and touch a couple of people, saying\\n“Good job today” to one and “Get on the phone; we’re in a\\nhurry to help people” to another. Let them see you paying\\nattention. While I am walking through our sales department, I\\nmight even intervene on a call and show them how it’s done. Most of the time, just your presence will get them back to the\\ngoal discussed in the sales meeting. CELEBRATE SUCCESSES\\n\\nOne day I received an e-mail from a client saying that they had\\ninvested $22,000 in one of our entry-level training products\\nand made $3 million in ninety days. Not a bad investment. I\\ngrabbed my phone, recorded a quick video in which I read the\\ne-mail and congratulated the team responsible, and then e-\\nmailed it to the VP of sales to play to the team. If you don’t have time to celebrate your staff and their\\nsuccesses, then you have your priorities wrong. A business\\ndepends on new and existing customers, and the energy\\nnecessary to get and keep those customers is vital to your\\ngrowth. You better get obsessed with your team’s success, or\\nyour people will soon slack to below average. Remember: Out\\nof sight, out of mind. The fish stinks from the head down. If\\nyou act like successes are not important, your team will act\\nlike they are not important. If you don’t have time to\\ncelebrate your staff and their\\nsuccesses, then you have\\nyour priorities wrong. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nCREATE COMPANY MOTTOS\\n\\nCome to my offices in Miami and you will see our company\\nmottos everywhere. I surround my people with my beliefs and\\nsayings. Every door to every office has a sign that speaks a\\nparticular message to that department. “We’re in a hurry to serve. ”\\n“Success is my duty. ”\\n“I refuse to let the customer not do business with us. ”\\n“No one can buy a lower price. ”\\n“When value exceeds price, people make decisions. ”\\n“If the buyer doesn’t buy, it’s our fault, not theirs. ”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I refuse not to call my customer back, even if they tell\\nme not to. ”\\n“Not buying my product costs you more than buying my\\nproduct. ”\\n“I do more than is asked of me. ”\\n“I don’t need to be here forever but I will be all here\\ntoday. ”\\n“I refuse to show up average. ”\\n\\nBury your employees in sales messages and feed them\\nwhatever they need to have the energy, motivation, and\\nconfidence to make that extra sales call. Instill in them what\\nyou are so aware of—that in each moment they can be\\nobsessed or be average, and that it is, in fact, a choice. Now that we’ve looked at how to feed the beast,\\npersonally and in your organization, we need to address the\\nother side of the coin: starving the doubt. D\\n\\nCHAPTER 5\\n\\nSTARVE THE DOUBT\\n\\noubt is the dream killer. Most people are so filled\\nwith doubt they are unable to believe in themselves\\nenough to become obsessed with their own success. Instead they let their fear lead the way. I believe that your fanatical, all-in mentality, which\\neveryone has caused you to doubt, is not the problem. Doubt is\\nthe problem. Doubt is the most dangerous and insidious form\\nof mental terrorism on this planet. Doubt damages people,\\norganizations, marriages, and dreams. It’s certainly been the\\nbiggest problem in my life. In the late 1990s I got caught up in that major movement\\nin America where it became popular to dig into your past and\\nfigure out the cause of your problems. A massive multi-\\nhundred-billion-dollar industry had grown around the idea that\\nMommy and Daddy gave you either too little attention or too\\nmuch. The focus became your so-called dysfunctional family\\nand your search for your “inner child. ” Everyone was talking\\nabout how broken they were and how their parents had\\nscrewed them up. Everything was labeled an addiction and a\\ndisease: work, sex, drugs, pets, love—there was even\\n“addiction to addicts. ” Because I have always been interested\\nin improving myself, for some time I went to group meetings,\\nattended twelve-step workshops, and sought out counselors\\nwho could help me find the cause of my “problems. ”\\n\\nDoubt is the most dangerous\\nand insidious form of\\n\\n\\n\\nterrorism on this planet. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nHere is the essence of that industry at the time: Regardless\\nof your label, you were ultimately powerless and you were\\ndestined to never get over it. Over the past twenty years this\\ntrend has continued. Some people can’t afford to buy a house,\\nbut everyone has a counselor, a rent-a-friend, who is more\\nlikely to talk about how screwed up they are than—heaven\\nforbid—how great they are. I once went to a counselor with\\nmy girlfriend and said, “I want to talk about how great I am. I\\nwant to talk about how many plus points I have, how many\\ngifts I have. I want to talk about my ambitions and successes. ”\\nThe counselor immediately recommended a prescription for\\nlithium. Clearly, he thought my obsession was dangerous. I am describing this so you can understand what you are\\ngoing against when you commit to your obsession to be\\nsuccessful. When I first began to turn my life around, I was\\nsurrounded by a whole industry that told me I was emotionally\\nscarred, powerless, and an addict of every variation. I was told\\nthat my obsessive nature was part of my genetic makeup, that I\\nhad no control over it and no chance of ever being free. This\\ncaused me deep confusion and doubt. Then one day, while I was attending a men’s weekend\\nworkshop, I looked around and realized that none of these\\nguys had anything close to the life I desired. They had been\\nassigning blame to parents and all these other factors outside\\ntheir “control,” focused on how broken they were, and broken\\nthey stayed. None of them were getting better.'}], 'max_tokens': 4096, 'temperature': 0, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}, 'output': {'id': 'chatcmpl-98Kb4BiuEknsKVHYjPiBPP6An0tH6', 'model': 'gpt-4-0125-preview', 'usage': {'total_tokens': 4002, 'prompt_tokens': 3561, 'completion_tokens': 441}, 'object': 'chat.completion', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{\\n  \"summary\": \"The passage discusses the author\\'s journey from leveraging his sales knowledge during a crisis to build a successful business, to the importance of daily team meetings, celebrating successes, and creating a culture obsessed with success.

Given a piece of text, chapterize and generate a JSON format as output. Follow the instructions below to help you in generating the output:\\n\\n1. **Understand the Key-Value Structure:**\\n   - A key-value pair consists of:\\n      - `\\'summary\\'`: A top-level overview or description of the chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'headers\\'`: A list of headers where a header is a line of text that introduces a new section or chapter in a document. It is typically formatted distinctly from the main body text to stand out, often being bolder, in a larger font, or differently styled. Headers are concise, summarizing the content that follows, and they guide the reader through the document\\'s structure. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'subheaders\\'`: A list of subheaders where subheaders are similar to headers but usually introduce subsections within a larger section. They are often formatted to be slightly less prominent than main headers, but still distinct from the body text. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'named_entities\\'`: A list of dictionary of named entities identified in the text. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'keypoints\\'`: A list of the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given text chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'tonality\\'`: The overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n\\n2. **Extract Relevant Information:**\\n   - Focus on extracting the most relevant information or identification from each chunk. This could include key themes, essential concepts, or significant details.\\n\\n3. **Perform Named Entity Recognition:**\\n   - Extract named entities from a given text and organize the results, providing the option for individual descriptions for each entity. \\n   - As part of the information extraction, identify and categorize any named entities, including but not limited to PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, etc., within the text.\\n   - The system should present the extracted entities in a structured format, allowing for detailed descriptions or additional information for each identified entity.  \\n   - Follow exactly the example below for the named entities:\\n\\n      named_entities = [\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_1>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_1>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1a>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_2>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1b>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with individual descriptions as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_2>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_3>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_4>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with a common description as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         # Add more entries as needed\\n      ]\\n   \\n   <Tag_1> and <Tag_2> represent different types of named entities.\\n   Each tag contains a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an entity and its associated description.\\n   Each entity can have an individual description.\\n\\n\\n4. **Determine the Tonality:**\\n   - Assess the overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Include this assessment under the key `\\'tonality\\'`.\\n\\n5. **Highlight the Keypoints:**\\n   - Identify and list the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given chunk under the key `\\'keypoints\\'`.\\n\\n6. **Header Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical to headers of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Look for any title case or all uppercase.\\n      - Position: Consider if any text is at the beginning of a section or stands alone.\\n      - Content: Assess if the text is concise and focused.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Note any numbering or special symbols.\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if any text introduces a new topic or section.\\n\\n7. **Subheader Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical of subheaders of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Subheaders often follow title case, but they might not always be in all uppercase, unlike some main headers.\\n      - Position: Check if the text appears within a section, usually following a main header. Subheaders are often used to introduce subtopics within a larger section.\\n      - Content: Determine if the text is more specific than a main header but still concise. It should elaborate on the content introduced by the main header.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Look for secondary or nested numbering or bullet points (e.g., \"1.1 Subsection\", \"• Subpoint\").\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if the text refines or narrows down the topic introduced by the main header, rather than introducing a completely new topic.\\n\\n8. **Generate Tags**\\n   - Please generate tags based on the given relevant information and strictly refrain from generating empty tags or empty array.\\n\\n9. **Provide Clear Details:**\\n   - Clearly present the information extracted from the piece of text. Ensure that the details are concise and informative.\\n\\n10. **Strict JSON Response:**\\n   - Strictly format your response as a JSON object.

Make the super successful your mentors. Buy their books, go to their conferences, read their interviews.

And economics doesn’t care\\nabout the color of your skin, your religion, your level of\\neducation, your intentions, or the goodness in your heart. It takes money to get anything done. From getting\\ngroceries to hiring people to being charitable to taking your\\ncompany public—it all takes money! That’s why paying\\nattention to and getting money must become part of your\\nobsessive quest. If you want to fly, you need money. You must become obsessed with feeding the beast of\\neconomics (money) so that it is not a constant and recurring\\nproblem dominating you and your company. VALUE MONEY\\n\\nThough people talk about how important money is, most\\nspend it on stupid things that in no way fuel their obsession. And then they hesitate when it comes time to invest money in\\nthings that will create more money. Is it any surprise that those\\nwith the smallest goals in life have the biggest problems with\\nmoney?\\n\\nThose with the smallest goals\\nhave the biggest money\\nproblems. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nLook at how the people around you treat money and you\\nwill see what I mean. A CFO says she is worth her $100,000\\nsalary because of her experience, then constantly complains\\nabout salespeople making too much money. What is worth\\nmore, counting the money or getting new money? The\\nmanager of a department sees nothing wrong with spending a\\nbusiness owner’s money on depreciating items like desks and\\ncomputers without even taking the time to get a second bid but\\nthen asks the accounting department to spend thirty minutes of\\ntheir time trying to find his missing airport parking receipt to\\nmake sure the company reimburses him $15. Priorities are so screwed up when it comes to money, at so\\nmany levels, it’s no surprise most companies never make any. When I was working at an oil refinery field in Lake\\nCharles, Louisiana, I would watch guys work dangerous jobs,\\nputting their lives at risk for twelve-hour shifts. And as soon as\\nthey would get their paychecks, they’d blow through all the\\nmoney they’d earned in one Friday night. It was amazing. These guys would always talk about how they should be paid\\nmore and would work overtime to get paid time and a half. The same people would then sit in a bar, complaining about\\nbeing underpaid and overworked and passing their money\\nacross the bar as if it meant nothing to them. One of the reasons I’m successful is that I’ve always been\\nobsessed with taking care of my finances and made money a\\npriority. I have always been transparent and open about\\nwanting more money, ever since I was a little kid. A lot of\\npeople would tell me—and they still do—that it was wrong to\\nwant so much and even more wrong to talk about it. “Never\\ntalk about money,” my mother said to me so many times. Most people are taught not to talk about money, so it’s no\\nwonder they don’t have any or have just enough to constantly\\nfret about it. I will never apologize for wanting to get my\\nfinancials stable, secure, and indestructible. I make it clear to\\nmy family, my employees, and my customers that I want lots\\nof money. I remember working with a customer who was\\ncomplaining about the price I was offering. I said to him,\\n“Money is important to my ability to succeed and service you. You want me to do well, don’t you? Great! Sign right here. ” I\\ndidn’t apologize for my price or the company’s need for\\nmoney. I will never apologize for wanting money—and I am\\ngoing to talk about it. I will never apologize for\\nwanting to get my financials\\nstable, secure, even\\nindestructible. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nGET YOUR MONEY RIGHT\\n\\nTo understand and feed the economic beast, you need to get\\nobsessed with getting your money right, in your life and in\\nyour business. When your money is wrong, you worry constantly about\\nshortages. If you aren’t making money or are just making\\nenough to barely get by or don’t have enough to dominate the\\ncompetition, you are doing money wrong. Money is funny,\\nkind of like a jealous lover. Pay attention to it or it will leave\\nyou for those who will. The first thing to do is to look at where your money is. If\\nyou have accounts with money in them, put that money to\\nwork. If you have assets or inventory that are worth money,\\nput those assets to work making you money. Also, cut\\nwhatever you can cut and be quick about it. Once you’re done\\nwith those cuts, you can spend the rest of your time expanding\\nand monetizing the valuable things in your life and in your\\ncompany. I treat all my companies like produce stands. My thought\\nis What do I have to exchange with the marketplace today that\\nmight be spoiled or no good tomorrow? I do this with my real\\nestate business, my technology business, and my consulting\\ncompanies. What apartments do we have that we can fill today\\nand turn into money? Do I have coaches and consultants not\\nworking this month whom I can get into the marketplace,\\nearning dollars? Do we have products sitting on our shelves\\nthat we need to get into the market, providing cash surpluses\\nso we can continue to grow?\\n\\nI treat all my companies like\\nproduce stands. What do I\\nhave to exchange with the\\nmarketplace today?\\n#BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nAlso, don’t miss this point I mentioned earlier: Once you\\ncut waste out of the organization, never look at that again, and\\ninstead focus on increasing income. You can’t grow your\\ncompany by making it smaller—you need to grow the top line. That’s where I invest most of my time, energy, and creativity. I\\nspend 95 percent of my time focused on getting money and 5\\npercent of my time on budgets. Invest in getting the attention\\nof people who will exchange their money for your products or\\nservices, not on worrying about your books all the time. In 2008 everyone was having difficulty with sales because\\nall the easy-credit money had disappeared. Companies were\\n\\n\\n\\nhaving enormous difficulty selling product. So I wrote a book\\ncalled Sell or Be Sold to address the problems the entire world\\nwas having in acquiring sales. I self-published the book and\\nwent door to door around America with it. I sold hundreds of\\nthousands of those books. I spend 95 percent of my time\\nfocused on getting money\\nand 5 percent on expenses. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nSell or Be Sold got me in front of the business owners and\\nit got me on television and radio. My message was “This isn’t\\na bad economy; it’s a real economy and everyone must learn to\\nsell. Sell or be sold. ” It got the marketplace’s attention and a\\nlittle bit of its money. I then reinvested that money in creating\\nother problem-solving products that I could scale out to tens of\\nthousands of businesses. I created Grant Cardone Sales\\nTraining University, which millions of salespeople,\\nentrepreneurs, and sales managers now use to obtain the\\nprofessional education that will make them highly productive\\nsalespeople. From their phones, tablets, computers, offices, or\\nhomes they can learn new ways to handle customers, grow\\nbusiness, get new customers, provide service, grow social\\nmedia presence, follow up, and more. It amazes me that such an enterprise arose out of\\neconomic devastation when I simply became obsessed with\\ngetting my money right. At a time of crisis, I looked at the\\nassets I had that I could bring to market.'}], 'max_tokens': 4096, 'temperature': 0, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}, 'output': {'id': 'chatcmpl-98KaqCmDPuZB2TmSSzaMODXSaCeG7', 'model': 'gpt-4-0125-preview', 'usage': {'total_tokens': 3953, 'prompt_tokens': 3558, 'completion_tokens': 395}, 'object': 'chat.completion', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{\\n  \"summary\": \"The passage discusses the importance of overcoming fears and doubts in achieving financial goals, emphasizing the need for continuous learning, valuing money, and focusing on economic growth.

Given a piece of text, chapterize and generate a JSON format as output. Follow the instructions below to help you in generating the output:\\n\\n1. **Understand the Key-Value Structure:**\\n   - A key-value pair consists of:\\n      - `\\'summary\\'`: A top-level overview or description of the chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'headers\\'`: A list of headers where a header is a line of text that introduces a new section or chapter in a document. It is typically formatted distinctly from the main body text to stand out, often being bolder, in a larger font, or differently styled. Headers are concise, summarizing the content that follows, and they guide the reader through the document\\'s structure. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'subheaders\\'`: A list of subheaders where subheaders are similar to headers but usually introduce subsections within a larger section. They are often formatted to be slightly less prominent than main headers, but still distinct from the body text. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'named_entities\\'`: A list of dictionary of named entities identified in the text. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'keypoints\\'`: A list of the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given text chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'tonality\\'`: The overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n\\n2. **Extract Relevant Information:**\\n   - Focus on extracting the most relevant information or identification from each chunk. This could include key themes, essential concepts, or significant details.\\n\\n3. **Perform Named Entity Recognition:**\\n   - Extract named entities from a given text and organize the results, providing the option for individual descriptions for each entity. \\n   - As part of the information extraction, identify and categorize any named entities, including but not limited to PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, etc., within the text.\\n   - The system should present the extracted entities in a structured format, allowing for detailed descriptions or additional information for each identified entity.  \\n   - Follow exactly the example below for the named entities:\\n\\n      named_entities = [\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_1>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_1>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1a>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_2>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1b>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with individual descriptions as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_2>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_3>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_4>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with a common description as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         # Add more entries as needed\\n      ]\\n   \\n   <Tag_1> and <Tag_2> represent different types of named entities.\\n   Each tag contains a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an entity and its associated description.\\n   Each entity can have an individual description.\\n\\n\\n4. **Determine the Tonality:**\\n   - Assess the overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Include this assessment under the key `\\'tonality\\'`.\\n\\n5. **Highlight the Keypoints:**\\n   - Identify and list the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given chunk under the key `\\'keypoints\\'`.\\n\\n6. **Header Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical to headers of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Look for any title case or all uppercase.\\n      - Position: Consider if any text is at the beginning of a section or stands alone.\\n      - Content: Assess if the text is concise and focused.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Note any numbering or special symbols.\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if any text introduces a new topic or section.\\n\\n7. **Subheader Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical of subheaders of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Subheaders often follow title case, but they might not always be in all uppercase, unlike some main headers.\\n      - Position: Check if the text appears within a section, usually following a main header. Subheaders are often used to introduce subtopics within a larger section.\\n      - Content: Determine if the text is more specific than a main header but still concise. It should elaborate on the content introduced by the main header.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Look for secondary or nested numbering or bullet points (e.g., \"1.1 Subsection\", \"• Subpoint\").\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if the text refines or narrows down the topic introduced by the main header, rather than introducing a completely new topic.\\n\\n8. **Generate Tags**\\n   - Please generate tags based on the given relevant information and strictly refrain from generating empty tags or empty array.\\n\\n9. **Provide Clear Details:**\\n   - Clearly present the information extracted from the piece of text. Ensure that the details are concise and informative.\\n\\n10. **Strict JSON Response:**\\n   - Strictly format your response as a JSON object.

Boom: A goal I had been obsessed with and fed daily\\nhad been achieved. This isn’t to say I simply wrote something each night and\\ndid nothing else. Because I was writing down this goal every\\nday, I also started to look at properties, make connections, and\\nlearn everything I could about the space. I shopped every\\nweekend for over five years, until I bought my first deal. And\\nas soon as I closed that deal, I rebooted my goals and started\\nwriting “I own more than 100 units that present cash flow over\\n12 percent per year” on my pad instead. Within ninety days I\\nhad already achieved that, and within the next three years I\\nowned 500 units. Today I own more than 4,500. People have laughed at me for keeping my little legal pad\\nnext to my bed all these years, but it has always been a way for\\nme to keep focused on where I am going. I remember when a\\ngirl I was dating asked me about the legal pad next to my bed,\\n“Do you write about me in that book?” I didn’t. In fact, when I\\nwrote about the girl of my dreams and my future wife, the\\nmental picture looked like someone completely different from\\nthe girl asking me this question. After I realized that, I never\\nsaw her again. If I had stayed with her, I would have been\\ntreasonous to my goals. I’ll give another example to show you how this works. I’ve always enjoyed writing, and since I was a little kid I’ve\\ndreamed that one day I would write a book. One day I wrote\\ndown on my legal pad: “I am a best-selling author who has\\nwon many awards for my books. ” I wrote this daily for years. One Sunday afternoon, years after I started writing that, I sat\\ndown in my office and wrote Sell or Be Sold in three hours. The book went on to sell hundreds of thousands of copies and\\nearn multiple awards. Since then I have written three more\\nbooks plus another dozen or so e-books that have gone on to\\nsell tons of copies, land on best-seller lists, win awards, and\\neven make me a little bit of money. Use this daily goal practice to remind yourself of where\\nyou’re going and why. Write your future in order to achieve it. Other successful people do this. Comedian Jim Carrey wrote\\nhimself a check for $1 million when he didn’t have $10 to his\\nname. Write your future in order to\\nachieve it. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nThe world needs more people who are obsessed:\\npassionate, driven, dedicated, all in, committed, relentless, and\\nalive. You can’t buy those things at the grocery store. Having a\\ngreat life is not going to be easy. Having a great life takes\\neffort. But it feels great to know where you are headed and\\nwhy and that any achievement means you’re one step closer to\\nyour ultimate potential. W\\n\\nCHAPTER 4\\n\\nFEED THE BEAST\\n\\nhat you pay attention to is what you get. And the\\nmore attention you give something, the more you\\nfeed it, the stronger and more powerful it grows. In life and business it is vital to pay attention to the things and\\npeople that are working for you and ignore the things and\\npeople that are not. The thought of reaching my\\npotential feeds me. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nSuccess feeds me. Winning feeds me. Production feeds\\nme. Reaching my potential feeds me. I make lists of the things\\nthat make me stronger and those that don’t, and I use those to\\nfeed the beast and starve anything that causes me doubt. Many people admire my drive—my constant, nonstop\\npush, my ability to stay the course long after others would\\nhave taken time off. They ask me: “What drives you?” This\\nmight be the most important question for anyone to answer. For me it’s an ongoing, moment-by-moment effort to feed the\\nbeast and starve the doubt. Actually, we’re not talking about “beast” singular—at any\\ngiven point in your life, you’ll want to feed multiple beasts at\\nthe same time. These are goals that want to be attended to, fed,\\nhonored, and exercised. Some of my beasts are being the most\\n\\n\\n\\nsuccessful guy in my space; getting my money right; being a\\ngreat husband, father, and philanthropist; and setting a great\\nexample for others. If you feed the beasts, your dreams have a chance of\\nbecoming reality. Ignore them or deny them and you will end\\nup with weird, destructive obsessions rearing their heads. At\\nthe very least, when you sit on them and suppress them, they\\nwill almost surely contort into envy, fear, doubt, and regret. Stay focused on what allows you and your business to\\ngrow, and invest no time, energy, or resources in those things\\nand people that don’t. FEED THE BEAST OF YOUR\\nOBSESSIONS\\n\\nIn this chapter I want to load you up with tools you can use to\\nfeed your beasts. Then, because doubt is your biggest threat\\nand therefore your biggest enemy, in the next chapter we’ll\\nlook at how powerful it is to deny something your attention, to\\nmake it so weak it loses any hold it once had on you. When you are truly obsessed with things that are good and\\nyou constantly feed them, all those things yanking at you—\\nself-esteem issues, introversion, disability, fear of success, fear\\nof failure, or any form of neurosis—fall away. Why? Because\\nyou don’t care about them. Your attention is fully on the good\\nstuff. I will never tell you that anything’s impossible, and you\\nshould never decide anything’s impossible. A total stranger\\ncame up to me recently and said, “I understand your goal is to\\nhave seven billion people know your name. You know that’s\\nimpossible, right?” I thought, This guy isn’t talking to me. He’s\\njust trying to make sense of all that he has given up on. I don’t\\nneed anyone to remind me how difficult, unlikely, or even\\ndangerous my goals are. I know all that. And I’m still going to\\n\\n\\n\\ngo for it because the alternative is too painful. I will judge\\nmyself less for coming up short than I would for never going\\nfor it. You need to face, master, and channel your obsessions\\ninto an engine of massive, energized momentum for the\\nsuccess you desire. Set your course of possibility. And then\\nfuel your engine with the highest-octane stuff you can get your\\nhands on. I will judge myself less for\\ncoming up short than never\\ngoing for it. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nSTAY LASER FOCUSED ON YOUR GOALS\\n\\nLots of people talk about goals as a good idea, a nice “to do. ”\\nBut not me and not any successful person I know. Goals aren’t a New Year’s resolution or a journal entry or\\na bumper sticker; they are critical to your life’s happiness and\\nfulfillment. I can’t stress this enough. Don’t write goals down\\non a Post-it note and look at them once in a while. Eat, sleep,\\nand breathe your goals. Not just because you “should” but\\nbecause you can’t not. Feed the beast so that it becomes so\\npowerful there is no room for doubt. Because the moment you\\ndivert focus from your goals or take your eyes off them, you\\nget lost in all the noise of your mind and the world. Wake up and go to sleep focusing on your goals. Write\\nthem down every morning and read them every night until\\nthey become a part of you. Once you internalize them, you\\nwill see everything around you as a means of achieving those\\ngoals. The moment you quit this practice, you will find\\nyourself falling into the repetitive cycle of work without\\npurpose. And don’t forget that goals will continue to mature and\\nchange. You will not write down the same goals five years\\n\\n\\n\\nfrom now that you write today. Wake up and go to sleep with\\nyour goals. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nROAR TOWARD THE FUTURE\\n\\nKeep your attention constantly focused on the future rather\\nthan the past. What will you create? What can you do that has\\nnever been done? Look at what’s in your windshield and\\ndisregard the rearview mirrors. Feeding the beast will keep\\nyou locked in on your future and the discovery of your\\npotential. For instance, as I write this, I own almost five thousand\\napartments that are probably worth around $400 million. When I was starting out, I couldn’t imagine owning that much\\nreal estate. I remember thinking, If I could get twenty units,\\nmaking me a little extra money every year, I would be thrilled. That’s all I could see then. Now, because I stayed with it and\\nallowed my goals to mature and expand as I achieved my\\ntargets, I am able to think with more of what I see as my full\\npotential.

In fact, I think trying to boil it down to one\\nsentence or one idea of your purpose is way too narrow. You\\nhave the capacity to be obsessed with many things, just as you\\nmay have many purposes in your life. But asking yourself\\nthese questions will help you identify positive obsessions that\\nwill lead you to your purpose. All together, your purpose is\\ncomposed of what constitutes a complete life for you. Once you know what your purpose is at this time, you can\\nstop your little acts of denial and self-sabotage that are\\nkeeping you from going forward. You can give yourself\\npermission to be obsessed with your true obsessions—that’s\\nthe first step. KEEPING YOUR OBSESSIONS\\nFRESH\\n\\nAll of life is a transition. You will work out what it is you are\\nsupposed to be doing and commit completely to that thing. Then there will come a time when you will again wonder what\\nyou are supposed to be doing, and the process of clarifying\\nyour purpose will start over again. Last year I was working with the Pentagon on a project to\\nhelp troops transition from military service back into civilian\\nlife. Many of these great people had committed to being career\\n\\n\\n\\nsoldiers. Now these veterans needed to move from an\\nenvironment with lots of structure, leadership, and clarity to\\njobs in companies that lack direction, where everyone is too\\nscared to make decisions, meetings don’t even start on time,\\nand employees complain about not having windows in their\\noffices. I told the soldiers, and I’ll tell you, from the moment you\\nare born to the moment you die, your life is in transition. It is\\nnot just the start and the finish that matter; it’s all the stuff in\\nthe middle. Those who are really alive and who make the\\nbiggest difference know how to keep updating and refocusing\\ntheir obsession as they mature, as life changes, and as\\nopportunities come and go. The key to tying your\\nobsession to your purpose is\\nto continue to set new goals\\nfor yourself. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nIt is challenging, but you must redefine who you are and\\nrefuel your obsessions as conditions change and your previous\\ngoals are achieved. This will determine how much you can get\\ndone in your time here. It is you continuing to create you. The key to tying your obsession to your purpose is to\\nalways set new goals for yourself. Someone might say, “If I\\njust had a million dollars, I would retire and play golf every\\nday. ” Then this guy gets there, plays golf every day for five\\nhours, becomes a 10 handicap, watches television the rest of\\nthe day, and hates his life. When he got there, he quit setting\\ngoals. As a result, he lost his way. Just as you reboot a computer by restarting it and\\nreloading the operating system, all people need to reboot\\nthemselves. We are all in transition, getting older, starting over\\n—and things change. The destination changes, conditions\\nchange, motivation changes. There are disappointments,\\n\\n\\n\\nchallenges, losses. If you don’t stay obsessed with where you\\nare going, you will become that person you don’t want to be:\\nlost, jaded, and wasting away. Purpose keeps me from\\nspending a lifetime wandering\\nplanet Earth without direction. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nI’ve been there; I’ve done that. When I didn’t know why I\\nwas getting up every day, I felt like I was dying inside. Purpose keeps me from spending a lifetime wandering around\\nplanet Earth without direction. So that you always understand your purpose and what you\\nshould be obsessed with at any given time in your life, let’s\\ntalk about igniting the power of writing your goals down every\\nday. DAILY GOAL PRACTICE\\n\\nWriting goals down daily is a great tool for staying focused,\\nrecommitting, and rebooting, because the destination will be\\nchanging a lot. It will also help you keep track of how far you\\nhave come from when you first started this practice—and learn\\na lot about yourself as well. First, though, let’s clarify what I mean by goals as\\nopposed to purpose. Goals are something you seek to achieve,\\nwhereas purpose is the reason you do something (your North\\nStar, the reason why you do what you do). In order to stay\\nobsessed with your true purpose, you need to be obsessed with\\nsetting and hitting your goals and continuing to feed your\\nfuture. I started writing down my goals the night I returned from\\nrehab, in order to get focused on what I would create in my\\nlife. Since then I have written my goals down every day. And\\nnot just at night but also first thing each morning and then\\nanytime I am feeling a bit down or lost. What I write is not what you would find on a “to do” list. When I talk about goals for the obsessed, I am not talking\\nabout achievable activities. I am talking about wins that are\\nout of reach at this time. I am talking about creating a\\npowerful future that pulls you forward constantly. This morning when I woke up, I rolled over to the legal\\npad I keep next to my bed and wrote: “I have $4 billion in real\\nestate holdings. ” Currently I have about $400 million in\\nholdings, so that number, ten times the current amount, seems\\na long way off. In fact, it’s so far off as to seem unachievable. But every day I just keep writing it down. And I write it down\\nin the past or present tense—not in the future tense or as a\\ndesire but as something I’ve already accomplished. I don’t\\nwrite down, “I want $4 billion in real estate holdings”—that\\nwould be all about desire and not about action. I assume my\\nmind accepts everything as reality. The goals of the obsessed\\nare always a bit out of reach. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nWhen I started this daily ritual of goals over twenty years\\nago, I would write, “I own twenty apartments or more. ” At the\\ntime, I hadn’t even bought one apartment and didn’t know\\nanything about apartments, management, financing, or even\\nhow to find an apartment deal. I was completely clueless about\\nthe space but knew innately I wanted to own apartments as an\\ninvestment. I had no idea how I would accomplish this goal;\\ntwenty units seemed as unreal to me then as $4 billion worth\\ndoes today. Still, I wrote this down every day for years until,\\nalmost five years later, I made my first multifamily real estate\\n\\n\\n\\ndeal, for forty-eight units in Vista, California, just outside San\\nDiego.'}], 'max_tokens': 4096, 'temperature': 0, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}, 'output': {'id': 'chatcmpl-98KaIGPiwoTRm2tuQObZQ77MIzFlc', 'model': 'gpt-4-0125-preview', 'usage': {'total_tokens': 4063, 'prompt_tokens': 3565, 'completion_tokens': 498}, 'object': 'chat.completion', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{\\n  \"summary\": \"The text explores the concept of identifying and pursuing one\\'s purpose through self-reflection on personal interests, motivations, skills, and aspirations.

Then find someone who is obsessed with creating an amazing\\nfamily and notice how passionately they talk of family first\\nand love of family and how dedicated they are to their\\nfamilies. Talk to an artist or athlete, someone who is obsessed\\nwith and constantly improving their particular talent, and see\\nthem come alive talking about that thing they do. You have to embrace this die-trying mentality. There can\\nbe no choices and no options. Yes, victory comes at a price—\\nso does settling. Sure, you might be totally and completely\\ninsane. But you’re not going to stop. Because history shows\\nthat only the obsessed make it—people like Alexander the\\n\\n\\n\\nGreat, Joan of Arc, Albert Einstein, Alexander Graham Bell,\\nThomas Edison, Elon Musk, Howard Schultz, Oprah, Vincent\\nvan Gogh, Steve Jobs, Christopher Columbus, Charlie\\nChaplin, Mozart, Michelangelo, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg,\\nLeonardo DiCaprio, Martin Scorsese, Jay Z, Beyoncé, Serena\\nWilliams, and on and on. There is no shortage of these people,\\nand like them or hate them, admire them or detest them, we all\\nknow them!\\n\\nWhether or not you agree with their missions or how they\\ngot there, you can’t deny that they were obsessed—and that’s\\nwhy you know their names. These are people who fought\\nagainst all odds and were unwilling to settle. Sure, none of\\nthem created the exact life I want or you want, because they\\nhad different dreams than we do. But you can use what they\\nhave done to fuel your own obsession. Because they gave\\npermission to some fanatical, unreasonable, obsessed\\nfascination with their dreams, you and I know their names. Is\\nthere a single person we both know the name of who wasn’t\\nobsessed? I doubt it. Now let’s get our names on that list. There isn’t a single person we\\nboth know the name of who\\nwasn’t obsessed. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\n\\n\\nA\\n\\nCHAPTER 3\\n\\nWHAT TO BE OBSESSED\\nWITH\\n\\ns you’ve been reading, you’ve probably been asking\\nyourself, How do I find what I am obsessed with?\\n\\nMaybe you already think you know. Maybe you\\ndon’t have a clue. Maybe you have lost your way. You could\\nbe young and confused or you could be in the midst of a life\\ntransition: changing jobs, getting over a relationship, or just\\ndone with feeling like you are out of fuel. I’ve been there. Throughout my life, for different reasons,\\nI have asked myself these questions again and again:\\n\\nWhy am I doing what I’m doing?\\n\\nWhat’s my purpose?\\n\\nWhat is going to get me excited?\\n\\nWhen you identify why you want to achieve something,\\nyou can fully and completely get obsessed with achieving it. This obsession is what you need to blow away any barriers or\\nopposition you run into on the way to your goal. YOU CAN OBSESS ABOUT\\nANYTHING\\n\\n\\n\\nWe’ve already talked about negative obsessions, including\\ndrugs, wasting time on social media, and other activities that\\nproduce no constructive outcomes. Then there are the positive obsessions. You can be\\nobsessed with spin class, losing weight, getting in shape, or\\ndoing a cleanse. You can be obsessed with supporting a\\ncharity, helping an ill parent, or conceiving a new baby. When\\nI talk about obsessions, I am talking about those obsessions\\nthat are worthy of your attention because they support your\\npurpose. The two are related but not the same: I was obsessed\\nwith getting rich because my purpose was to make sure my\\nfamily never had to worry, scraping and struggling in the\\nmiddle class like I did as a kid after my dad died. Purpose is the holy grail of the obsessed. I see purpose as\\na person’s reason for doing something or the reason for which\\nsomeone or something even exists. It is the “why” of all whys\\nand the fuel for your obsessions. To get you started on the path to thinking big, then bigger,\\nthen massively as you move toward your purpose, I’ll tell you\\nthat just because I started this road of obsession doing sales at\\na car dealership doesn’t mean I loved it. It wasn’t my dream\\njob. It wasn’t even what I was passionate about. The first two\\nyears I sold automobiles, I absolutely hated it. But I became\\nobsessed with making myself great at the job and eventually I\\nfell in love. Thanks to my dad, I have never been stuck believing that I\\nhad to like something in order to commit myself to it. When I\\nwas nine years old, I remember watching him working in the\\nyard, picking up pecans, sticks, and leaves and stuffing them\\ninto a trash bag. He was doing it so attentively and precisely\\nthat it appeared to me that he loved every second of it. I asked\\nhim, “Dad, do you like doing that?” He replied, “You don’t\\nalways need to like what you do to love what you do. ”\\n\\nMy father was obsessed with taking care of his family and\\nattaining success so he could provide for us, and that meant\\n\\n\\n\\ndoing things I am certain he didn’t like or want to do. Simple\\nas that. You don’t need to like what\\nyou do to love what you do. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nI remembered that when I committed to being a great car\\nsalesman. I acted like I loved it, even though I didn’t\\nparticularly like selling cars. I put a smile on my face when a\\ncustomer wouldn’t even shake my hand. I sat making endless\\ncold calls to people who hung up on me or told me to never\\ncall them again. When everyone else went home at 6:00 p. m. , I\\nwas still there at midnight making deals. As you find your purpose and identify those things worthy\\nof becoming obsessed with; remember that you don’t need to\\nlove your job or even do what you are passionate about to get\\nobsessed enough to be successful. That said, we don’t want to leave it at that. It’s important\\nto figure out what those obsessions are that are worthy of your\\nattention. FIGURE OUT WHAT YOUR PURPOSE\\nIS\\n\\nTo understand what my purpose is and to keep fueling it, I\\nconstantly ask myself questions. These questions have opened\\nmy mind up to so many directions, inspired me to accomplish\\ngreat things, and kept me alert to opportunities in sync with\\nmy obsession. When you start answering these questions, do not second-\\nguess yourself. Answer the question with the first response\\nthat comes to you—without any judgment and without trying\\n\\n\\n\\nto figure anything out, especially how you are going to arrive\\nat the answer. You don’t even need to decide to follow through\\non something, unless you want to. Just ask yourself the\\nquestions. Then, at the same time tomorrow, do it again. And then do\\nit again the next day and the day after that. Over time you may\\nnotice that you come up with new answers or that the same\\nanswers keep coming up. You may see surprising patterns or\\nbe reminded of a dream that was buried long ago.'}], 'max_tokens': 4096, 'temperature': 0, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}, 'output': {'id': 'chatcmpl-98KZuHh8Sy2Cy04bIsf1i58uplk7g', 'model': 'gpt-4-0125-preview', 'usage': {'total_tokens': 3834, 'prompt_tokens': 3086, 'completion_tokens': 748}, 'object': 'chat.completion', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{\\n  \"summary\": \"The text discusses the importance of obsession in achieving greatness, citing examples of famous individuals known for their relentless pursuit of their goals.

If you can’t pay your own bills, how are you going\\nto help out the person who needs help? If you can’t make your\\ndreams a reality, how are you going to encourage another to?\\nYou can’t!\\n\\nSO MUCH AVERAGE ADVICE\\n\\nSociety has always had a problem with people like you and\\nme. We see ourselves as entrepreneurial, scrappers,\\ncompetitors, hard workers, risk takers, and committed. Others\\nsee us as abnormal, problematic, driven, greedy, never\\nsatisfied, overly demanding, tyrannical, self-serving,\\nunreasonable, control freaks, and so on. Those who don’t get it\\n—including your friends, family, employees, and colleagues—\\nwill tell you things like:\\n\\n“Slow down. ”\\n“Life is to be enjoyed. ”\\n“Don’t work too much. ”\\n“Don’t work too hard. ”\\n“Take it easy. ”\\n“Be grateful—someone else is worse off than you. ”\\n“Life is short. ”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Money isn’t everything. ”\\n“Bigger isn’t better. ”\\n\\nThese folks, spellbound by their belief in work-life\\nbalance, fitting in, getting along, and fairness and equality for\\nall, make up reasons for you to abandon your dream. Obsession, they say, is unhealthy. But what about their\\nobsession with comfort, with being normal, with having no\\ndrive and no purpose? What about the plague of doubt billions\\nof people have contracted, which makes them settle into\\naverage lives? Think about the mom who gave up on writing a\\nbook, the schoolteacher who gave up on his dream of owning\\nhis own business, the businessman who gave up on his desire\\nto be an artist? All of these people refuse to take risks so that\\nthey can have order. Have you ever noticed that the person who shouts out\\n“Success isn’t everything” is the guy or gal who has none?\\nThese mottos are freely dispensed, and very few ever take the\\ntime to even lightly inspect their veracity. All these people are\\ngoing through life spouting off to others, “Abandon your\\ndreams of fame, fortune, and power because you might not\\nmake it!” Remember: People who try to persuade you to give\\nup are not trying to help you. They are trying to make sense of\\nwhy they gave up. The reality is none of those people ever make anything\\nmore than excuses. Doesn’t mean they are bad people. But\\nthey aren’t going to change the world and they won’t support\\nanyone else in changing the world. THE DISTRACTION OF THE MASSES\\n\\nAdd to that the fact that every day, we are hammered\\nrelentlessly with distractions, lies, political agendas, crises,\\nterror, and false hopes. This constant bombardment makes\\npeople believe they are powerless—mere spectators in their\\nown lives who only know how to just get by. People who try to persuade\\nyou to give up are not trying\\nto help you, they’re trying to\\nmake sense of giving up. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nMillions of people spend three to four hours of their\\nworkday scanning Facebook and then go home to watch hours\\nof television on ninety-inch screens they bought on credit. They’re hypnotized by the national media’s coverage of the\\nmost recent terrorist attack, missing plane, and celebrity\\nscandal. Or they’re glued to one of so many made-up sagas\\nabout cops solving crimes or battles in imaginary kingdoms. Turn those off, and you live in a world where there are\\nmore mobile devices than human beings. We are being blasted\\nby 24-7 Internet jabber, Twitter feeds in the hundreds of\\nbillions, eight billion daily Snapchat and YouTube videos,\\ntrillions of useless posts every day, and now streaming video\\nwhere everyone can be a broadcaster puking mindless content. Not to mention we’re constantly being spammed with\\npornography, celebrity fascinations, and bouncing cats. With this much distraction coming at you nonstop, the\\nchance for success is slight. But you can break out of the average cycle—in fact, you\\nmust. Average is a failing formula and it works for no one, no\\nmatter how much they try to make sense of it. Unhappy people\\ncan’t teach you how to be happy. The poor can’t teach you\\nhow to get rich. A guy in a failing marriage cannot teach you\\nhow to make your marriage work. An average person can’t\\nteach you how to be exceptional. I have a saying I live by: “Never take advice from a\\nquitter. ” And let me be clear—average people are quitters. They quit striving for a better life and quit short of their\\npotential. Never take advice from a\\nquitter. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nSo how can you live above the average line? By being all\\nin and obsessed. Let’s look at some people who have proven\\nthat. YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS\\nYOUR DREAMS\\n\\nSteve Jobs said: “I want to put a dent in the universe. ”\\n\\nMartin Luther King Jr. said: “I have a dream. ”\\n\\nGandhi said: “Be the change you want to see in the\\nworld. ”\\n\\nBill Gates said: “Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces\\nsmart people into thinking they can’t lose. ”\\n\\nMuhammad Ali said: “I am the greatest. ”\\n\\nYou know these people and their words and their work\\nbecause they were obsessed. They stayed obsessed long after\\nothers had dismissed them. Sure, people tried to get them to\\njust enjoy life a little more. They were called crazy, arrogant,\\ntroublemakers, insane, wacked, fanatics, and more. In the end,\\nthough, they each changed the world. These people weren’t superheroes; they didn’t possess any\\nspecial powers. They were just completely obsessed. This led\\nto their unshakable dedication, unreasonable efforts, and\\nenduring commitment to go far beyond what any average\\nperson would do in order to make their dreams a reality. They\\ndidn’t simply play in the game; they were obsessed with\\nshaping it. No, none of these people were perfect. But each of them\\ncreated a legacy that will live on for centuries. Their names\\n\\n\\n\\nwill inspire hundreds of millions of people to consider what it\\nmeans to be great, to accomplish great things, to stand for\\ngreat change. Was Muhammad Ali just an expert fighter? I\\nthink not. His story inspires men and women of all races,\\nreligions, and ages with the message that in order to have\\ngreatness, you must claim it. Stand up and claim your greatness. Because no matter\\nhow much concern or love another person has for you, they\\ndon’t have your dreams. Those belong only to you and they\\nmake you unique. Most likely you had your dreams before you\\nhad most of the people who are in your life now. Your friends,\\nkids, spouse, and family may love you, but that doesn’t mean\\nthey share your dreams and desires. They have their own. Rather than taking advice from them, lowering your\\nstandards for them, or giving up altogether for them, see if\\nthey pursue their dreams with obsession, using every waking\\nmoment to realize those dreams. Because you will. You will\\ndo everything to make them a reality, and it will require many\\nchoices and sacrifices. If they are not willing to do that, it is\\nclear that they themselves have given up on their dreams and\\ndesires. Don’t be surprised—most people have. So be sure you\\nnever take advice from them. They will try to persuade you to\\ndo the same as they did—and live a smaller life. No matter how much love\\nanother has for you, they\\ndon’t have your dreams. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nTHE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN\\nHOOKED ON SUCCESS AND\\nOBSESSED\\n\\n\\n\\nGetting hooked on the idea of success and actually being\\nobsessed enough to pursue it are two completely different\\nthings. Just wanting to be great isn’t enough. I’ve shed sweat,\\nblood, tears—and put my ass on the line more times than I can\\ncount—to get to where I am today. I hate to break it to you, but you’ll need to do the same. There’s no such thing as obsession lite. There is no such thing\\nas part-time obsession. If you want to lead the pack, you need\\nto abandon the idea that some other, milder version of\\nobsession is an option. “Sometimes obsessed” or “only\\nobsessed on weekends” or “obsessed between the hours of\\n8:00 a. m. and 5:00 p. m. ” is a fantasy. There is no sense of\\nbalance for those bitten by their obsessions and doing\\nsomething spectacular. There is no such thing as\\npart-time obsession. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nRegardless of your industry, obsession is mandatory for\\nthe kind of success I’m talking about. The obsessed know that\\nif they aren’t all in on their venture, they will get rolled over\\nby others who are.

Given a piece of text, chapterize and generate a JSON format as output. Follow the instructions below to help you in generating the output:\\n\\n1. **Understand the Key-Value Structure:**\\n   - A key-value pair consists of:\\n      - `\\'summary\\'`: A top-level overview or description of the chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'headers\\'`: A list of headers where a header is a line of text that introduces a new section or chapter in a document. It is typically formatted distinctly from the main body text to stand out, often being bolder, in a larger font, or differently styled. Headers are concise, summarizing the content that follows, and they guide the reader through the document\\'s structure. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'subheaders\\'`: A list of subheaders where subheaders are similar to headers but usually introduce subsections within a larger section. They are often formatted to be slightly less prominent than main headers, but still distinct from the body text. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'named_entities\\'`: A list of dictionary of named entities identified in the text. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'keypoints\\'`: A list of the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given text chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'tonality\\'`: The overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n\\n2. **Extract Relevant Information:**\\n   - Focus on extracting the most relevant information or identification from each chunk. This could include key themes, essential concepts, or significant details.\\n\\n3. **Perform Named Entity Recognition:**\\n   - Extract named entities from a given text and organize the results, providing the option for individual descriptions for each entity. \\n   - As part of the information extraction, identify and categorize any named entities, including but not limited to PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, etc., within the text.\\n   - The system should present the extracted entities in a structured format, allowing for detailed descriptions or additional information for each identified entity.  \\n   - Follow exactly the example below for the named entities:\\n\\n      named_entities = [\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_1>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_1>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1a>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_2>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1b>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with individual descriptions as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_2>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_3>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_4>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with a common description as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         # Add more entries as needed\\n      ]\\n   \\n   <Tag_1> and <Tag_2> represent different types of named entities.\\n   Each tag contains a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an entity and its associated description.\\n   Each entity can have an individual description.\\n\\n\\n4. **Determine the Tonality:**\\n   - Assess the overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Include this assessment under the key `\\'tonality\\'`.\\n\\n5. **Highlight the Keypoints:**\\n   - Identify and list the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given chunk under the key `\\'keypoints\\'`.\\n\\n6. **Header Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical to headers of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Look for any title case or all uppercase.\\n      - Position: Consider if any text is at the beginning of a section or stands alone.\\n      - Content: Assess if the text is concise and focused.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Note any numbering or special symbols.\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if any text introduces a new topic or section.\\n\\n7. **Subheader Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical of subheaders of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Subheaders often follow title case, but they might not always be in all uppercase, unlike some main headers.\\n      - Position: Check if the text appears within a section, usually following a main header. Subheaders are often used to introduce subtopics within a larger section.\\n      - Content: Determine if the text is more specific than a main header but still concise. It should elaborate on the content introduced by the main header.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Look for secondary or nested numbering or bullet points (e.g., \"1.1 Subsection\", \"• Subpoint\").\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if the text refines or narrows down the topic introduced by the main header, rather than introducing a completely new topic.\\n\\n8. **Generate Tags**\\n   - Please generate tags based on the given relevant information and strictly refrain from generating empty tags or empty array.\\n\\n9. **Provide Clear Details:**\\n   - Clearly present the information extracted from the piece of text. Ensure that the details are concise and informative.\\n\\n10. **Strict JSON Response:**\\n   - Strictly format your response as a JSON object.

Still today I have both sides of this: the\\nawareness and the gnawing drive to do more. And to be\\ncompletely honest, I have never thought much about past\\nsuccess.

You deserve massive\\nsuccess so abundant it can’t\\nbe disrupted, taken away,\\ndiminished, or stolen. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nThose who suggest you should settle for less than your\\npotential are doing so because they are trying to make sense of\\na decision to settle for less in their own lives. Actually, they\\ndidn’t settle—they quit. They quit short of their potential and\\nnow are trying to make sense of why they did so. There is no\\nexception to this. The super successful will never tell anyone\\nto do less, to settle, or to be satisfied. Those who have actually\\nmade it big would never tell you it’s a pipe dream and will\\nalways encourage you to do more. Prepare yourself: When you commit to this obsessed\\nthing, you will be labeled an outlier, a freak, and a weirdo. Remind yourself you aren’t the problem. The problem is the\\nworld we’ve living in. END THE EPIDEMIC OF AVERAGE\\n\\nI believe that one of the reasons my message can sound so\\nshocking is that we’re suffering from an epidemic of average. So many in the shrinking middle class set their sights on\\nwhat it takes to just get by, instead of what it takes to thrive\\nand prosper and set themselves up for true success. The middle\\nclass is failing to provide real freedom for anyone and only\\nensures that you live a life of fear and constant worry. To\\nunderstand how deep this epidemic runs, consider the\\nfollowing:\\n\\nStudies by Bankrate. com suggest that somewhere\\nbetween 62 percent and 76 percent of Americans live\\npaycheck to paycheck, including many with what used\\nto be solid, reliable middle-class jobs and middle-class\\nincomes. According to a 2012 Washington Post article, over half\\nof the U. S. population is on some form of government\\nassistance. According to Forbes, there are currently over 28 million\\nsmall businesses in America, 75 percent of which are\\nrun by solopreneurs who, by definition, work alone and\\nhave no employees—which means they do everything\\nthemselves. This same study shows that of all small businesses 92\\npercent make less than $250,000 a year and 67 percent\\nbreak even or lose money. According to MarketWatch, in 2015 Americans had over\\n$1. 3 trillion in college debt. That is more debt than all\\ntheir credit card debt combined. And what did all that college debt produce? According\\nto a study by CareerBuilder, over 30 percent of college\\ngraduates do not work in the field they studied in\\ncollege. We finance “American dream” homes with thirty-year\\nmortgages that have barely gone up 1 percent per year\\n(adjusted for inflation) since the Great Depression. According to Gallup polls, the average American works\\nunder thirty-five hours a week and almost 70 percent of\\nAmericans are disengaged at their jobs. Whether you are one of these statistics or not, you know\\nsomeone who is. Consider all the college kids who took on\\nstudent-loan debt, only to have to move back in with their\\nparents. What about home ownership, which has gone down\\nfrom almost 68 percent to the lowest levels since the 1950s?\\nYou and I are living among these people even if we are not\\nthem, and we are therefore seriously influenced by their mind-\\nset and their actions. People are failing because of how they\\nthink and how little they can do. So many in the middle class\\nset their sights on what it\\ntakes to simply get by,\\ninstead of thrive and prosper. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nThere’s a popular saying that you are the composite of the\\nfive people you spend the most time with. Look around: If the\\npeople you see aren’t screaming success, they are validating\\naverage. People are lazy because it is tolerated. People accept the\\nidea of average because their parents and peers told them it\\nwas all right to settle for less rather than become obsessed with\\ntheir dreams. If knowledge is power, and I believe it is, then the issue is\\nthat most of us are getting the wrong knowledge. People are\\nbeing encouraged to be happy, and they spend their lives\\ntrying to buy happiness with borrowed money from credit\\n\\n\\n\\ncards they must pay off with money they earn from a job they\\nhate. People are sold on the idea if they finally get into the\\nmiddle class, they’ll be better off than 80 percent of the world\\n—only to find themselves dumbfounded as to why they have\\nno time for their families and no money left over for pleasure. If the people you see aren’t\\nscreaming success, they are\\nvalidating average. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nAnd sure, that whole “We’re all in this together” mantra\\nthat our culture promotes sounds nice, but if you can’t take\\ncare of your own dreams, how can you ever take care of your\\nneighbor? If you can’t pay your own bills, how are you going\\nto help out the person who needs help? If you can’t make your\\ndreams a reality, how are you going to encourage another to?\\nYou can’t!\\n\\nSO MUCH AVERAGE ADVICE\\n\\nSociety has always had a problem with people like you and\\nme.'}], 'max_tokens': 4096, 'temperature': 0, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}, 'output': {'id': 'chatcmpl-98KZROb2zUiihEtDxj6G8EqoPqTeY', 'model': 'gpt-4-0125-preview', 'usage': {'total_tokens': 4004, 'prompt_tokens': 3560, 'completion_tokens': 444}, 'object': 'chat.completion', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{\\n  \"summary\": \"The text emphasizes the importance of striving beyond average, exploring one\\'s full potential, and the dangers of settling for mediocrity.

Given a piece of text, chapterize and generate a JSON format as output. Follow the instructions below to help you in generating the output:\\n\\n1. **Understand the Key-Value Structure:**\\n   - A key-value pair consists of:\\n      - `\\'summary\\'`: A top-level overview or description of the chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'headers\\'`: A list of headers where a header is a line of text that introduces a new section or chapter in a document. It is typically formatted distinctly from the main body text to stand out, often being bolder, in a larger font, or differently styled. Headers are concise, summarizing the content that follows, and they guide the reader through the document\\'s structure. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'subheaders\\'`: A list of subheaders where subheaders are similar to headers but usually introduce subsections within a larger section. They are often formatted to be slightly less prominent than main headers, but still distinct from the body text. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'named_entities\\'`: A list of dictionary of named entities identified in the text. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'keypoints\\'`: A list of the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given text chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'tonality\\'`: The overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n\\n2. **Extract Relevant Information:**\\n   - Focus on extracting the most relevant information or identification from each chunk. This could include key themes, essential concepts, or significant details.\\n\\n3. **Perform Named Entity Recognition:**\\n   - Extract named entities from a given text and organize the results, providing the option for individual descriptions for each entity. \\n   - As part of the information extraction, identify and categorize any named entities, including but not limited to PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, etc., within the text.\\n   - The system should present the extracted entities in a structured format, allowing for detailed descriptions or additional information for each identified entity.  \\n   - Follow exactly the example below for the named entities:\\n\\n      named_entities = [\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_1>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_1>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1a>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_2>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1b>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with individual descriptions as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_2>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_3>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_4>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with a common description as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         # Add more entries as needed\\n      ]\\n   \\n   <Tag_1> and <Tag_2> represent different types of named entities.\\n   Each tag contains a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an entity and its associated description.\\n   Each entity can have an individual description.\\n\\n\\n4. **Determine the Tonality:**\\n   - Assess the overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Include this assessment under the key `\\'tonality\\'`.\\n\\n5. **Highlight the Keypoints:**\\n   - Identify and list the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given chunk under the key `\\'keypoints\\'`.\\n\\n6. **Header Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical to headers of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Look for any title case or all uppercase.\\n      - Position: Consider if any text is at the beginning of a section or stands alone.\\n      - Content: Assess if the text is concise and focused.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Note any numbering or special symbols.\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if any text introduces a new topic or section.\\n\\n7. **Subheader Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical of subheaders of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Subheaders often follow title case, but they might not always be in all uppercase, unlike some main headers.\\n      - Position: Check if the text appears within a section, usually following a main header. Subheaders are often used to introduce subtopics within a larger section.\\n      - Content: Determine if the text is more specific than a main header but still concise. It should elaborate on the content introduced by the main header.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Look for secondary or nested numbering or bullet points (e.g., \"1.1 Subsection\", \"• Subpoint\").\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if the text refines or narrows down the topic introduced by the main header, rather than introducing a completely new topic.\\n\\n8. **Generate Tags**\\n   - Please generate tags based on the given relevant information and strictly refrain from generating empty tags or empty array.\\n\\n9. **Provide Clear Details:**\\n   - Clearly present the information extracted from the piece of text. Ensure that the details are concise and informative.\\n\\n10. **Strict JSON Response:**\\n   - Strictly format your response as a JSON object.

Unfortunately, most people never figure out what they are\\nreally obsessed with, because they’ve been taught to deny their\\nobsessions. Don’t let that be you. Find something, anything,\\nthat you are obsessed with. It doesn’t matter what it is right\\nnow, because you are just going to take the urges, momentum,\\nand fixation on that thing and redirect them. Maybe you’re obsessed with fantasy football and spending\\ntoo much time on it. Okay. Or maybe you are obsessed with\\none particular relationship that is destructive. Fine. This only\\ngoes to prove you could be obsessed with something else too. Maybe your obsession is Candy Crush or online poker or\\nplaying chess on the street with old men. Even if you are\\n\\n\\n\\nobsessed with things you know can in no way produce\\ngreatness in your life, it doesn’t matter at this moment. What\\nmatters at first is realizing you have the capacity to be\\nobsessed. Your obsession means you have the juice to do great\\nthings. Your obsession can get you out of the culture of\\naverage (more on that in the next chapter). Now you just need\\nto channel the monsters and redirect the energy to something\\npositive and constructive. Don’t try to stifle or reduce the\\nobsession. Instead, give yourself permission to use it and\\nredirect it. NO LIMITS\\n\\nMost of you reading this will not, I hope, have wasted a day or\\na dime on drugs. Hopefully you didn’t lose your father when\\nyou were ten. But you don’t need to go through those\\nexperiences to tap into the power of obsession. To have what you want in life, you must give yourself\\npermission to throw yourself all in on your dreams. Make it\\nclear to others that you are obsessed and that, though you\\nwould like their support, any expectations they may have of\\nyour staying where you are, settling for less than you dream,\\nor being average will have to take a backseat. Ask yourself, How far up can I go? How much more can I\\ndo? And most important, What do I want to become\\ncompletely obsessed with that will lead to success?\\n\\nBeing obsessed doesn’t take into account your education,\\nyour money, or even your abilities. You’ll need them\\neventually, but none of them matter if you haven’t first given\\nyourself permission to be obsessed. It’s all about your desire\\nand willingness to see a goal all the way through, despite huge\\nobstacles. Obsession saved my life, changed my life, and has given\\nme the life I am living today. It can do the same for you. B\\n\\nCHAPTER 2\\n\\nOBSESSION IS YOUR ONLY\\nOPTION\\n\\necause you picked up this book, I already know\\nyou’re a big thinker, a big dreamer, and someone who\\nwants to be a huge success. You’re also probably extremely frustrated. You know you\\ncan do more. Every time you see others achieving greatness,\\nyou wonder, Why am I not doing that? Those succeeding\\naren’t necessarily smarter than you. They don’t work harder\\nthan you. So why them and not you? Even if you are a\\nmultimillionaire, you know the truth: You could be a\\nbillionaire. Or maybe you are an artist and your work sells, but\\nyou know you should be recognized internationally. If you\\nhave this gnawing desire to be great, if you have a big dream\\nand the talent—and I believe you do—then you should be\\nfrustrated!\\n\\nDon’t feel like you fit in? That’s a good thing. You stay up\\nat night unable to sleep, constantly thinking about a better way\\nor bigger idea? Also a good thing. Do you hate having people\\ntell you how well you are doing when you know can do more?\\nAwesome! Never satisfied with any success you achieve?\\nPerfect. All of these unsettled feelings are signs that you are\\nobsessed. Never allow anyone to tell\\nyou how well you are doing\\nwhen you know can do more. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nI figure you are in one of the following three positions:\\n\\nYou got off track from pursuing your big dreams\\nbecause society told you your plans were too unlikely or\\ntoo audacious. As a result, you’ve toned down your\\nmessage and belief over the years, buying into the idea\\nthat obsession is unhealthy. Maybe you’ve been\\nconditioned to fit inside a box instead of breaking out of\\none—and you’re trading in your dreams of greatness for\\na cute house, a 401(k), and a two-hour commute. Business ideas that used to keep you up all night have\\nbeen shelved in favor of weekends on the couch in front\\nof the TV. It’s not that you’re lazy; it’s that you’ve been\\ntold too many times by your friends and family that this\\nobsession of yours is unhealthy, that your dreams are\\nunattainable, and you’ve bought it. You have a clear vision for your success but need\\nvalidation that will operate as additional fuel for your\\nsuccess explosion. You’re on track but not operating as\\nquickly or as well as you could be in becoming a\\nmassive winner. You know with certainty that you have\\nto be fanatical to have any remote chance at making\\nyour dreams a reality. All eighty billion cells in your\\nbody are consumed with the idea of success; now you\\nneed to figure out how to make it happen. This is the first time anyone has told you it’s okay to be\\nthe obsessive freak you always wanted to be. Maybe\\nyou’re a person who knows in the back of their mind\\nthat obsession isn’t a bad thing but isn’t living it yet. You picked up this book because the title reminded you\\nof what you gave up on some time ago and made you\\nrealize how far you’ve moved away from a powerful\\nforce that you wish could be reawakened within you. Maybe you never knew that obsession was an option, let\\nalone the only option. Wherever you’re coming from as you hold this book,\\nyou’ve definitely watched others no smarter than you bring\\nideas to the marketplace and become millionaires and\\nbillionaires. Enough of that. ONLY YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR\\nYOUR SUCCESS\\n\\nThe obsessed embrace the fact that they—and only they—are\\nresponsible for their success. You and only you can settle for\\nless. At the end of the day, people may feel sympathy for you,\\nthey may offer a shoulder to cry on, but no one has enough\\nemotional bandwidth or financial capacity to help you when\\nyou don’t make it. There are billions of people on this planet living in daily\\nemotional turmoil, knowing they are living and operating\\nbelow their potential. No one feels sorry for you. No one is\\ngoing to help you. Being obsessed is the only way to create enough success\\ntoday to ever be an inspiration to others and actually make a\\ndifference on this planet. Being obsessed is required in order\\nto have enough significant bandwidth to provide guidance and\\nsupport for all the people who need help. After I had become\\nsuccessful, I used to tell my uncle Vince my dreams of doing\\neven bigger things, and he would say, “If you can, you must. ”\\n\\nThe obsessed embrace the\\nfact that they—and only they\\n—are responsible for their\\nsuccess. #BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\n\\n\\nIT’S OKAY TO WANT IT ALL\\n\\nThere are thousands of books on success, but few of them\\nactually match up with my definition of success. It’s not just a\\nsteady job, the respect of your peers, and a nice little nest egg\\nfor your retirement. I’ve always wanted—and still want—to be\\nmassively successful. For me success has never been about one thing, one\\nachievement, one dream, one aim, or one goal. I have always\\nwanted a lot of things. A girl I dated years ago often told me,\\n“You want to have your cake and eat it too. ” I responded,\\n“Why would I want my cake if I can’t eat it?” I have always\\nwanted many things, not just one thing. For me—and, I would expect, you—success is about\\nbeing great at many things. I certainly wouldn’t be satisfied\\nwith just being rich. I want it all: health, wealth, family, love,\\nrecreation, spirituality, community, and time to enjoy it all. Why settle for one color when you can have the rainbow?\\n\\nWhy settle for one color when\\nyou can have the rainbow?\\n#BeObsessed\\n@GrantCardone\\n\\nFor me success is defined as the attainment of my\\npotential. My assessment of this potential has changed over\\nthe course of my life. At twenty-five I thought my potential\\nwas just to not use drugs on any given day. A year later I was\\nfocused on paying off $40,000 in debt and getting my income\\nto $60,000 a year. By the time I was twenty-nine and starting\\nmy first business, my goal was to match the $100,000 a year I\\nhad made in automotive sales. All of those achievements,\\nlooking back, were way beneath my potential. Thirty years and thousands of paid speaking gigs, awards,\\nbooks, and TV appearances later, my potential is still being\\nrevealed to me as I push myself and have new experiences.

Everything just started flowing out of me as I gave\\nmyself permission to write about my new life. I wrote more:\\nabout wanting to write books one day, about becoming a\\nmaster salesperson. I even wrote about becoming a husband\\nand a father. I remembered what I had told my mom when I was\\nsixteen, before everything went bad: “When I grow up, I’m\\ngoing to get rich so I never have to worry about not having\\nenough money. And when I do, I am going to help a lot of\\npeople. ” At that moment I realized drugs had become a\\nproblem for me not because I was obsessed with drugs but\\nbecause I had given up on the things I had been obsessed with\\nat an earlier age, particularly success. You know the old saying “What you resist will persist”?\\nWhen I had resisted my call to greatness and suppressed my\\nobsession, the energy had gone into destructive behavior. I\\nmade a decision that night to never again fight my desire to be\\nsuccessful and to help other people too. I knew the first step in getting back on track to success\\nwas to help myself. I couldn’t start helping others until I got\\nmy own life in order. I had to rebuild my sense of self before I\\ncould ever get others to believe and trust me. But where could\\nI start? I had no friends. My ex-girlfriend, also an addict, was\\nnow sleeping with a drug dealer. All I had was my job at the\\ncar dealership. Even though I hated the job, I decided I would throw\\nmyself into my sales job 100 percent and use it as my\\njumping-off point. I committed to learning everything I could\\nabout sales and the automobile industry and using any free\\ntime to help others know the truth about drugs and how\\ndestructive they are. I resolved to take all my obsessive energy\\nand redirect it toward rebuilding my life the way I wanted it. I went to bed after writing my new-life manifesto feeling\\ninspired and clearheaded for the first time in years. I showed up for work at the car dealership the next\\nmorning an hour early—embarrassed, self-conscious, scared\\n\\n\\n\\nof what others thought about me, short on confidence, and not\\nknowing where to start. The owner welcomed me back with\\nopen arms, which was great. I realized later he had probably\\nsaved my life by giving me a place to put my life back\\ntogether. My first day back was awkward but good. I actually sold\\nsomething. I stayed at work later than everyone else, probably\\nscared to go home. Free time was a threat to me because I\\nknew when and if I got bored or didn’t have something\\nproductive to do, I was at risk of returning to my old ways. Six months later I was still clean, and my dedication and\\ncommitment to my new manifesto and my obsession with\\nstaying clean, rebuilding my life, and creating success for\\nmyself were paying off. I had become the dealership’s top\\nsalesperson. I was outperforming guys who’d worked there for\\nyears, all of whom stood around scratching their heads,\\nwondering what my “secret” was. They thought it was that I\\nwas no longer using drugs. Wrong! Certainly I couldn’t have done what I was doing\\nwhile on drugs, but simply not using drugs was not the secret. I knew plenty of people who had left treatment and were not\\nwinning in their careers. The “secret” was that instead of being\\nobsessed with horrible habits, I allowed myself to become\\nobsessed with success again with the same innocence and\\nenergy I had as a kid. Rather than denying my obsession with\\nsuccess, I gave myself permission to embrace it. I was starting to get a taste of how life could be. I was\\nmaking money for the first time and saving all of it. More\\nimportant, for the first time in years I felt good about myself. My self-esteem was returning and I was starting to find my\\nswag and belief in myself again. Though I was a long way\\nfrom the kind of success I had dreamed of, I finally knew I\\nwas headed in the right direction. For the first time I was doing what I had said I would do. I\\nwould wake up in my little apartment, feed my dog, shower,\\nand watch a sales training video while I ate breakfast. On my\\n\\n\\n\\ndrive to work each day, I’d listen to self-improvement and\\nsales training tapes with the commitment to become the best of\\nthe best. In the first year I probably spent seven hundred hours\\njust improving myself as a salesperson. I arrived an hour\\nbefore everyone else, and many nights I was still there after\\nten o’clock. When I wasn’t working in the dealership, I was\\ntrying to help other drug addicts. Every month I was better than I had been the month\\nbefore: I was selling more, I was making more money, and I\\nwas rebuilding my self-esteem. And every month I was one\\nmore month removed from my past. Months added up to years, and by the time I turned\\ntwenty-eight, I wasn’t the kid with the drug problem anymore. I was a solid sales professional in the top 1 percent of\\nsalespeople in the entire auto industry. I was starting to think\\nbigger too, even entertaining grandiose ideas of one day\\nbecoming a sales legend like the guys I was studying every\\nday, someone who was known for sales worldwide and taught\\nmillions of others about sales and maybe even wrote books\\nand programs to help other salespeople. I had done the\\nopposite of what that counselor had said and was throwing\\nmyself completely into my new obsessions. I was obsessed\\nwith my obsessions, and my life was starting to bear fruit and\\ncreate a future consistent with the dreams I had had as a kid. Success became my new drug. I finally began to\\nunderstand how to make my obsessive nature work for me, not\\nagainst me. I thought this was a great change in mind-set—so I\\nwas surprised and upset when the people who believed in me\\nand worked with me every day reacted badly to my new\\nphilosophy. I remember a friend grabbing me and saying, “You\\nare replacing one addiction with another. ” I couldn’t believe\\nanyone would compare what had taken my life from me with\\nthe commitment I had made to creating success for me. But he wasn’t the only one. Lots of people had concerns. They were happy I wasn’t using drugs but didn’t understand\\nthat recovering from a drug addiction wasn’t enough for me. Coworkers were saying, “Life isn’t all about work. ” Even the\\n\\n\\n\\nguy who owned the car dealership said, “I think you should\\nrelax a little bit and take some time off. ” My family was\\nconcerned about my burning out and relapsing. Sorry, but no. I had been in very low places—and I wasn’t\\ngoing back. Hitting that massive bottom in my life had given\\nme something to bounce back from, and I wanted to bounce\\nback as high as possible. If I could go that low and survive, I\\nthought, how high could I go in the other direction?\\n\\nNo matter how troubling it was to others, it was this\\nobsession with success that had given me a new lease on a\\nnew life. I was really beginning to understand its power and\\npossibility. OBSESSION IS A GIFT\\n\\nIn my life being obsessed with success has never created\\nproblems for me. Denying my obsession is what caused me\\nproblems. The drugs came as an alternative at a time when I\\nwas squelching my ideas and dreams of doing great things. In\\nfact, every time in my life when I denied my desire to create\\nan amazing life, I found myself being seduced by activities\\nthat caused me trouble. When you learn how to control and focus your obsessions,\\nyou will become a powerful and unstoppable person capable\\nof making all your dreams a reality. You can create the life you\\ndeserve, free of all the neuroses and destructive behaviors\\nmost often confused with what I am promoting here. When I finally quit fighting my obsessive mentality and\\nstarted to nurture my obsessions, everything changed for me. When I quit defending, drugging, and diminishing my\\nobsessions and dreams of success, all my energy was renewed. When I started studying other obsessive types who were super\\nsuccessful and stopped seeking advice from those who were\\nsettling for average lives, average results, average money,\\naverage everything and who were never obsessed with\\n\\n\\n\\nanything except defending average, that’s when I began to\\nreally live. When I started to own the fact that I was obsessed with\\npersonal fantasies of indestructible wealth and fame and the\\ndesire to create a legacy that would outlast my time on this\\nplanet, the world looked different. I seemed to get younger\\novernight, my creativity seemed endless, my genius was\\nawakened, and I started to attract other people more like me. Opportunities started to present themselves that used to never\\ncome my way. Obsession itself is not a deficit or a character defect; it’s a\\ngift! The next time someone starts labeling your obsession an\\nillness, a problem, or some aberration, tell them, “I’m not\\nafflicted, I’m gifted. ”\\n\\nThe next time someone starts\\nlabeling your obsession an\\nillness, tell them, “I’m not\\nafflicted, I’m gifted.

Why should anyone have only enough money to get\\nby—and still need to worry about money? When things would\\ncool down, I would try to explain to my mother that it wasn’t\\nthat I didn’t appreciate everything she did for us or that I\\nwasn’t grateful for everything we had. The reality is I would\\ncontinue to have this push/pull, right/wrong argument about\\nscarcity and money with myself and others for years to come. Anytime I had a blowup, my mom (and later my\\ngirlfriends and friends) would always say the same thing: “But\\nwe have it so much better than others. ” I never understood that\\nresponse. First off, what do others have to do with my life?\\nSecond, anytime I compared myself with others who had more\\n—people who were really living the life—my mom,\\ngirlfriends, and friends would come back with “Don’t compare\\nyourself to others. ” There was no winning. I would tell myself over and over, One day I am going to\\nmake it big. But I quit telling my mom this because every time\\nI did, she would reach down, hug me, and say, “Why can’t you\\njust be grateful for what we have?” And then she would start\\n\\n\\n\\ntelling me again how she had grown up taking care of five\\nsiblings, with no money and not knowing where the next meal\\nwas coming from. This was the cycle—the constant loop aiming to talk me\\nout of what I thought possible for me and what I wanted. No\\nmatter how many times I tried to convince myself of my\\nmother’s logic, it never added up for me. Dad works his ass\\noff, finally makes it, buys his dream house, dies, and leaves\\nthe family terrified every time we go to the grocery store\\nbecause we are worried about running out of money? Ugh, no\\nthanks. Looking back, I realize I was the only one making any\\nsense at all about how the world actually worked. OBSESSED WITH THE WRONG\\nTHINGS\\n\\nI was unable to do anything to remedy the family’s situation at\\nthat time: I was young and frustrated and, frankly, I didn’t\\nknow how. With too much time on my hands and no strong\\nmentorship in my life, I got busy becoming a problematic\\nteenager instead. By the time I was in high school, I was a handful. I also\\nhad a big mouth and was very opinionated; I was disruptive in\\nschool and would get kicked out of class. Add to that the fact\\nthat I was always hanging around the football players’\\ngirlfriends, so I was getting into weekly fights with the\\nfootball team at school. In general, I caused more trouble than\\nmy poor mother knew what to do with. By the time I graduated from high school, I had also fallen\\nin with the wrong crowd: drinking, smoking, and\\nexperimenting with drugs. Drugs became a daily issue in my\\nlife. I started smoking weed at sixteen, and by the time I was\\nnineteen, I was using anything and everything available. Short\\n\\n\\n\\nof shooting dope, I tried it all. I had developed a massive daily\\ndrug problem. I did go on to college, because my mother had promised\\nmy dad, before he died, that their kids would go. I felt\\nobligated to go, even though I didn’t really see the point. I\\nwasted five long years in college, never paying attention in\\nclass, taking almost nothing away from it, yet maintaining\\ngrades good enough to stay in school. Eventually I graduated\\nwith an accounting degree I had no intention of using—and\\n$40,000 in debt from college loans. It wasn’t a pretty picture. At twenty-three I was at least\\ntwenty pounds underweight and had a gray complexion,\\nthanks to drugs. I had become the black sheep of my family. Despite my earlier pronouncements of wanting to be rich, I\\nfound myself with no abilities, no self-esteem, and no\\ndirection. I managed to get a job at a car dealership, but it was\\na dead-end job for me. And then came the kicker. As a result of hanging out with\\nthe wrong people and being obsessed with the wrong things, I\\nwas beaten up within an inch my life. I spent three days in a\\nhospital after almost bleeding out in my apartment. It took\\nseventy-five stitches in my head and face to fix me up. Not\\neven my mother could recognize me. The scars are still visible\\non my face today, around both eyes and my mouth. The people who loved and believed in me the most had no\\nidea how to help me. Hell, I didn’t know how to help me. Even almost being beaten to death in my own home didn’t\\nchange me. Every day I swore to myself, I will not use drugs\\ntoday, only to find myself moments later doing the very drugs\\nI had promised I would not use again. In fact, nothing changed for another two years. I continued\\nto use daily. I hated everything about my life at the time—my\\njob, the auto industry, coworkers, the people I hung out with,\\nthe apartment I lived in. I hated myself too. The only thing I\\nstill cared about was my dog, a 140-pound Doberman named\\nCapo whom I’d had for six years—and I was starting to\\n\\n\\n\\nneglect even Capo. I had become a cause of concern for\\neveryone who loved me and a disappointment to so many who\\nwanted to believe in me. I was broke and broken—financially,\\nemotionally, spiritually, and even physically. The weekend of my twenty-fifth birthday I went to visit\\nmy mom at her place, not far from the dumpy apartment I\\nrented for $275 a month. I showed up at my mom’s place\\nloaded, slurring my words, tongue swollen from barbiturates. My mom, exasperated, finally gave me the big ultimatum:\\n“Don’t come around here anymore until you get your life\\ntogether. ”\\n\\nI knew I had to change or I was going to die without even\\ngetting a chance to prove—to myself or to her—that I could be\\nsomething. When I told the owner of the car dealership that I needed\\nto get help for my drug problem, he suggested I try to handle it\\nmyself. It was the first time I admitted to anyone that I\\ncouldn’t. I told him, “If I could quit by myself, I would have\\nstopped five years ago. ”\\n\\nA few days later, with the help of a family friend, I\\nchecked myself into a rehabilitation treatment facility. I was\\nterrified and hopeful. Twenty-nine days later, when my insurance coverage ran\\nout and the treatment center couldn’t get any more money\\nfrom me, I was sent back to the world I had left. The only\\nthing good about treatment was that I learned that I could go\\ntwenty-nine days without a drug. On my way out the door, the counselor in charge of me\\ngave me a parting shot. “You’ll never make it,” he said. “You\\nare a defective person. You have an addictive personality. You\\nhave a disease you can never recover from. You have no\\npower or control over your disease or your life, and the\\nchances of you never using drugs again are zilch. The most\\nsuccessful thing you can do with your life at this point is never\\nuse again. Focus on anything else and you will fail. Drop all\\nyour grandiose ideas of money, fame, and success. ”\\n\\n\\n\\nWow. What a motivational message. I had taken a big step in seeking help, and while the\\ntreatment center gave me the chance to get off drugs, by no\\nmeans had it rehabilitated me or addressed the reasons I had\\ngotten into drugs in the first place. I left that place as broken as\\nI had been when I had entered. In fact, my uncertainty about\\nmy life and my abilities was heightened because I was no\\nlonger under the influence. And that’s what they call\\n“recovery”? I hadn’t recovered. I was also acutely aware of\\nhow fragile I was for the first time. When I stepped out the door of the treatment center, I\\nmade a personal commitment to never return to drugs—and to\\nuse the “addictive personality” the counselor had so tried to\\nconvince me would be my downfall to rebuild my life. REIGNITING MY OBSESSION FOR\\nGOOD\\n\\nOnce back home in my little dump of an apartment, with only\\nmy dog for company, I sat down at my kitchen table with a\\npiece of paper. In rehab they had you write a lot, but it was all about your\\npast, about your damage and bad experiences. No more of that,\\nI thought. I needed to look to the future. I had to stop focusing\\non where I had been and start looking toward where I wanted\\nto go. I started writing down what I wanted to do with my life. I\\nwanted to make my family proud of me. I wanted to be proud\\nof me. I wanted desperately to prove the counselor wrong. I\\nwrote down that I wanted to clean up all the damage I had\\ndone and become a respectful member of society. I wanted to\\nprove to the world that I was worth something. I wanted to be\\nsuccessful and wealthy, a respected businessman and someone\\nwho could help others, just as I had once told my mother I\\n\\n\\n\\nwould.'}], 'max_tokens': 4096, 'temperature': 0, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}, 'output': {'id': 'chatcmpl-98KYneNBz11ZmJMvRfsKRwXByE1fW', 'model': 'gpt-4-0125-preview', 'usage': {'total_tokens': 4039, 'prompt_tokens': 3549, 'completion_tokens': 490}, 'object': 'chat.completion', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{\\n  \"summary\": \"The passage narrates the personal journey of an individual struggling with scarcity, addiction, and a lack of direction, eventually leading to a moment of self-realization and a commitment to change.

Whether you are an entrepreneur, business owner,\\ntrailblazer, freethinker, artist, athlete, inventor, salesperson,\\ncreative, or engineer, I know you are someone who strives for\\nsuccess and refuses to settle. This book will encourage and\\nfuel that can’t-quit, won’t-quit, accelerator-to-the-floor\\nmonster ambition inside you. I will help you establish your brand and business and\\nshow you how to grow it to staggering heights despite all\\nobstacles and competition. This is because obsession is the\\ncritical component of success—senior to strategy, pricing,\\ntiming, competition, or people; it offers the method for living\\nin true freedom and total control of your life—personally,\\nfinancially, and emotionally. When you become unapologetically obsessed, as I am,\\nyou’ll be at your very best: hyperfocused, persistent beyond\\nunderstanding, creative to the point of appearing magical, and\\nwith an insatiable determination to win that not only attracts\\ngreat talent but also brings out the best in others. This level of\\nobsession doesn’t mean you are selfish and self-centered; it\\nmeans that you’re finally operating at the levels you were\\nalways meant to and that you can pull others around you up to\\ntheir full potential and possibilities. The obsessed are the industry builders, disrupters, titans,\\ngame changers, and living legends others admire and wish to\\nemulate. The obsessed don’t just make the world go around. They make the world worth living in. It’s my goal that this book will influence you and millions\\nof others around the world to create a new movement. A\\nmovement where we give one another permission to embrace\\nand fuel our obsessions. Imagine if every person on earth threw themselves fully\\nand completely into their positive obsessions without\\nreservation, regret, or apology. Overnight the world would be\\na different and better place. With everyone so focused on their\\nown production and creating their own success, there would be\\nno time for war, drugs, or other wasteful, unnecessary\\ndestruction. We’d all hit levels of success previously thought\\nimpossible—and inspire one another to do more and be more.

F\\n\\nCHAPTER 1\\n\\nOBSESSION SAVED MY\\nLIFE—AND IT WILL SAVE\\nYOURS\\n\\nor you to understand how I became successful and\\nlearned about the amazing power of obsession, I first\\nneed to show you how denying my obsession almost\\n\\nruined my life. It’s not a pretty story but it is my real one. And I wouldn’t\\nbe surprised if you found some parallels to your own life in\\nmine. THE ROOTS OF MY OBSESSION\\n\\nI didn’t have a father who could lead me to the land of the\\nrich, lend me a million dollars for my first real estate deal,\\nassist with political connections through introductions at\\ncountry clubs, or show me the ways of business. My parents were the children of Italian immigrants who\\ncame to America in the early 1900s. Dad was the first in his\\nfamily to attend college. He was an ambitious young man with\\nan entrepreneurial spirit who believed the American dream\\nwas within reach, starting with a little grocery store he and my\\nmother operated. Dad was obsessed with success because he believed that\\ntaking care of his family was his first duty. From a very early\\nage I got that my dad’s number one mission in life was to\\nprovide for his family: putting a roof over our heads and\\nmaking sure we had food, clothes, and an education. A few years before I was born, Dad took on an ambitious\\nplan to start his own life insurance company with a couple of\\npartners. I don’t know all the details of what happened with\\nthe life insurance company, but his partners ousted him and he\\nwound up in a tough situation. At forty-two years of age, my\\ndad found himself out of work with three kids to support and\\ntwins on the way (me and my twin brother, Gary). He had to\\nstart over. He decided to use the little bit of money he had in\\nsavings to become licensed as a stockbroker, embarking on yet\\nanother new career. Thanks to his work ethic and obsession with providing for\\nhis family, his new venture started to pay off. He bought a new\\ncar that he was very proud of, a Lincoln Town Car. Just after\\nmy eighth birthday, we moved to a new home on a sprawling\\none-and-a-half-acre lakefront property. We owned a boat for\\nfishing and water-skiing and a riding lawnmower. Doctors,\\nwho at that time were the most successful people in the\\ncommunity, lived on both sides of us. My dad’s hard work and\\nsuccess at the stock-brokerage firm had gotten our family\\nfirmly into the middle class. I often overheard my mom and\\ndad talking about how we had “made it. ” Even as a young kid\\nI knew something special had happened. The next two years with my family at that lakefront home\\nwere an amazing part of my childhood . but it didn’t last\\nlong. Only a year and a half after my dad bought his dream\\nhouse, he died of a heart condition at the young age of fifty-\\ntwo. My mother found herself a widow at forty-eight years old\\nwith five kids, a little bit of life insurance money, and a big\\nhouse in the country that required constant attention. My\\nmother had no professional skills she could use in the\\nmarketplace to bring in new income. She had dedicated her\\n\\n\\n\\nlife to being a wife and mother. And now she needed to figure\\nout how to conserve the money my dad had left and stretch it\\nlong and far to get all five kids through college. This was a big challenge, as my mother had no college\\neducation and did not have income earning potential. She had\\ngrown up in the Great Depression and didn’t want to see her\\nfamily have to struggle the way people had then. So my mom\\nbecame obsessed, if you will, with making sure the little bit of\\nmoney my dad had left us would be enough to get by. She saw everything as a future expense and a threat and\\nquickly began to downsize. She immediately put my father’s\\ndream house on the market. We were forced to move into the\\ncity, to a tiny brick house on a tiny lot, surrounded by houses\\nthat all looked exactly the same. The lake was gone; no more\\nboating, fishing, crabbing, and hunting just outside our door. I\\nwas crushed. In our new house there was grief—we all missed my\\nfather. On top of that, though, my mom was scared, and I\\ncould feel it. There was constant fear around her. While other\\nboys my age were out with their dads playing sports, hunting,\\nand fishing, I was at home watching my mother clip coupons,\\nalways worried about the cost of basic necessities and so on. My mom could make pennies bleed. Her scarcity mind-set was\\npart of everything we did. At the same time, Mom was constantly reminding me of\\nhow very, very lucky and grateful I should be for all that we\\ndid have. She would claim, “Your father got us into the middle\\nclass—we have more than most. ” I would hear this over and\\nover. “Never take any of this for granted. ”\\n\\nI tried being grateful for and appreciative of all that we\\nhad, but it never sat right with me. The whole thing seemed so\\nscrewed up to me. I was ten years old, my dad was dead, the\\ndream house was gone, mom was living in fear, and I was\\nsupposed to be grateful? I wasn’t grateful—I was pissed!\\n\\nI didn’t know it then, but this time seeded what would\\nlater drive me in life. As much as I loved, admired, and\\n\\n\\n\\nappreciated my mom for what she did for me in making sure\\nwe had clothes, food, and a roof over our head, I didn’t want\\nto live my life in a constant state of worry. At the age of\\nsixteen I vowed to my mother, “When I grow up, I’m going to\\nget rich so I never have to worry about not having enough\\nmoney. And when I do, I am going to help a lot of people. This\\nmiddle-class thing sucks. I am going to get mine!”\\n\\nAs soon as I said it, I knew I sounded like a spoiled,\\nungrateful, disrespectful, rebellious, snot-nosed, punk\\nteenager. My mother had that look on her face that every\\nparent gets when a kid crosses the line. She was furious,\\ndisappointed, and frustrated. Still, I felt an overwhelming\\nsense of powerlessness, knowing I couldn’t do anything about\\nanything at the time. My flare-ups became more and more common. And the\\nmore I had them, the more I knew I was both wrong and right. I knew I should be grateful—so many other people had less\\nthan us. But I also knew there was truth in what I was\\nthinking.'}], 'max_tokens': 4096, 'temperature': 0, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}, 'output': {'id': 'chatcmpl-98KYWReYxHKL9B2EUYiJ8eTLCsEob', 'model': 'gpt-4-0125-preview', 'usage': {'total_tokens': 3901, 'prompt_tokens': 3527, 'completion_tokens': 374}, 'object': 'chat.completion', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{\\n  \"summary\": \"The text outlines the transformative power of obsession in achieving success and personal freedom.

Given a piece of text, chapterize and generate a JSON format as output. Follow the instructions below to help you in generating the output:\\n\\n1. **Understand the Key-Value Structure:**\\n   - A key-value pair consists of:\\n      - `\\'summary\\'`: A top-level overview or description of the chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'headers\\'`: A list of headers where a header is a line of text that introduces a new section or chapter in a document. It is typically formatted distinctly from the main body text to stand out, often being bolder, in a larger font, or differently styled. Headers are concise, summarizing the content that follows, and they guide the reader through the document\\'s structure. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'subheaders\\'`: A list of subheaders where subheaders are similar to headers but usually introduce subsections within a larger section. They are often formatted to be slightly less prominent than main headers, but still distinct from the body text. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'named_entities\\'`: A list of dictionary of named entities identified in the text. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'keypoints\\'`: A list of the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given text chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'tonality\\'`: The overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n\\n2. **Extract Relevant Information:**\\n   - Focus on extracting the most relevant information or identification from each chunk. This could include key themes, essential concepts, or significant details.\\n\\n3. **Perform Named Entity Recognition:**\\n   - Extract named entities from a given text and organize the results, providing the option for individual descriptions for each entity. \\n   - As part of the information extraction, identify and categorize any named entities, including but not limited to PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, etc., within the text.\\n   - The system should present the extracted entities in a structured format, allowing for detailed descriptions or additional information for each identified entity.  \\n   - Follow exactly the example below for the named entities:\\n\\n      named_entities = [\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_1>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_1>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1a>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_2>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1b>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with individual descriptions as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_2>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_3>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_4>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with a common description as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         # Add more entries as needed\\n      ]\\n   \\n   <Tag_1> and <Tag_2> represent different types of named entities.\\n   Each tag contains a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an entity and its associated description.\\n   Each entity can have an individual description.\\n\\n\\n4. **Determine the Tonality:**\\n   - Assess the overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Include this assessment under the key `\\'tonality\\'`.\\n\\n5. **Highlight the Keypoints:**\\n   - Identify and list the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given chunk under the key `\\'keypoints\\'`.\\n\\n6. **Header Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical to headers of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Look for any title case or all uppercase.\\n      - Position: Consider if any text is at the beginning of a section or stands alone.\\n      - Content: Assess if the text is concise and focused.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Note any numbering or special symbols.\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if any text introduces a new topic or section.\\n\\n7. **Subheader Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical of subheaders of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Subheaders often follow title case, but they might not always be in all uppercase, unlike some main headers.\\n      - Position: Check if the text appears within a section, usually following a main header. Subheaders are often used to introduce subtopics within a larger section.\\n      - Content: Determine if the text is more specific than a main header but still concise. It should elaborate on the content introduced by the main header.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Look for secondary or nested numbering or bullet points (e.g., \"1.1 Subsection\", \"• Subpoint\").\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if the text refines or narrows down the topic introduced by the main header, rather than introducing a completely new topic.\\n\\n8. **Generate Tags**\\n   - Please generate tags based on the given relevant information and strictly refrain from generating empty tags or empty array.\\n\\n9. **Provide Clear Details:**\\n   - Clearly present the information extracted from the piece of text.

I’ve been called a work addict, compulsive,\\nobsessive, never satisfied, out of balance, tyrannical, and\\nimpossible to work with. I’ve been told I’m too demanding\\nand that I have unreasonable expectations for myself and\\nothers. I have had “professionals” suggest that I have ADD,\\nADHD, OCD, and much more. Friends and family have told\\nme to chill out, calm down, relax, and take it easy. The reality is that no matter how much I have tried to\\nsquelch or control my obsession with success, it has been the\\none thing most responsible for my being where I am today. My\\nobsessions have taken me from lost and broken in every way\\nat the age of twenty-five to owning five privately held\\ncompanies with sales of $100 million a year, being named one\\nof the top ten most influential CEOs in the world, and being a\\nNew York Times best-selling author of five books, an\\ninternationally acclaimed speaker, an attentive husband, a\\ndoting father of two girls, and a contributing member of\\nsociety. I am not bragging—I just want to make perfectly clear\\nthat what I’ve achieved in life is not because of some\\nparticular invention, luck of timing, inside deal, or special\\nintelligence. I am where I am today only because I embraced\\nmy obsession with success. That being said, before I gave myself permission to fully\\nown my obsession and harness it for good, denying my\\nobsession almost killed me. I learned the hard way that\\n\\n\\n\\ndenying your obsession or being obsessed with the wrong\\nthings can be very destructive. I’m going to share my story about discovering my\\nobsession and how that alone has given me this super life. I\\nwill share with you the tools I’ve discovered along the way to\\nput my obsession to work for me. I want to give you\\npermission to be completely and unapologetically obsessed too\\n—regardless of who you are, where you come from, what your\\nfamily is like, or what your crazy big dream is. —\\nBefore I wrote this book, I wrote The 10X Rule, a best seller\\nabout the importance of thinking and executing at massive\\nlevels. In short: If you are going to have a budget for a project,\\nyou should set it for 10X what you initially considered; if $1\\nmillion is the amount of money you want to earn annually,\\nthen you better set a target of $10 million per year, in order to\\nget close to where you desire. The 10X Rule was ultimately\\nabout multiplying your goals to achieve any objective. After I released The 10X Rule, so many people wrote me\\nsaying things like, “I am trying to 10X my business and I am\\nhaving trouble staying with it” or “This 10X thing is throwing\\nmy entire life into disruption. ” That’s when I realized that\\nthere was a missing piece to the puzzle—the idea of obsession. Obsession is the missing piece, that mind-set that will allow\\nyou to apply the 10X rules in your life and business. Sure, you can be successful without being obsessed, but\\nyou can’t reach the levels of success I am talking about\\nwithout being obsessed. It’s the single common factor that\\nsuper successful people around the world share. To show you how to become obsessed and harness that\\nobsession to build your own success, I’ve broken this message\\nand guide down into manageable chapters. The first chapter of Be Obsessed or Be Average explains\\nhow obsession saved my life and why it’s so important. I\\n\\n\\n\\ndefine obsession and what it means to me. Chapter 2 will erase\\nthe conventional wisdom that average and safe are all you can\\nachieve and explain why you need to replace mediocrity and\\ndoubt with a burning, purposeful, animal obsession. Then in\\nchapter 3 we’ll look at how you can identify your own\\nobsession. I’ll walk you through some key exercises you can\\nuse to find out what you really want most in life. The next chapters build on that foundation, guiding you\\nthrough the tough process of beginning to follow your\\nobsession. I’ll prove why it’s important to “feed the beast” of\\nyour obsession in chapter 4. In chapter 5 we’ll explore why\\nyou need to “starve the doubt,” block out naysayers, and\\nembrace haters. Chapter 6 talks about all the ways you can\\nlearn to use your obsession to dominate—your past, your\\nthinking, your money, your area of expertise, and your brand. And chapter 7 explains why playing it safe is the most\\ndangerous thing you can do—and how to stay dangerous\\nagainst great odds. These principles will guide you in your\\nquest for success. Then we’ll shift to practical business advice that will help\\nyou make your obsession real, not only to you but to everyone\\naround you. In chapter 8 I’ll share my world-renowned sales\\nknowledge to help you understand the importance of sales to\\nrealizing your obsession and how to become a monster\\nmarketer, promoter, and salesperson. Chapter 9 will focus on\\nwinning customers—and how you can overpromise and\\noverdeliver. In chapter 10 we’ll turn to the people you work\\nwith, especially employees, and I’ll show you how to build a\\nculture around you that is totally aligned with your obsession. We’ll close out chapter 11 with advice on how to be a real\\nleader—or in my words, “how and why you must be a control\\nfreak. ” These are all the practices you will need in order to not\\njust maintain but grow your obsession into a thriving,\\nlucrative, and powerful business that can maybe even create an\\nentirely new industry or disrupt an existing one. The last two chapters of the book talk about how to\\nsustain your obsession over time. In chapter 12 we look at the\\n\\n\\n\\npower of persistence as your obsession matures and morphs\\ninto something beyond what you can imagine today. And\\nbefore I let you go to change the world, in chapter 13 I will\\nshare final tips and techniques on getting, being, and staying\\nobsessed. We’ve all read the generic books that tell you to follow\\nyour dreams. But while those books might offer inspiration,\\nthey don’t tell you how to really make a permanent change in\\nyour life. This book will be brutally honest. It will tear down\\nthe cocoon of average that has been spun so tightly around you\\nby society.'}], 'max_tokens': 4096, 'temperature': 0, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}, 'output': {'id': 'chatcmpl-98KY8h5RlVeQ2p6ChWknmu9WFA4Hj', 'model': 'gpt-4-0125-preview', 'usage': {'total_tokens': 4135, 'prompt_tokens': 3548, 'completion_tokens': 587}, 'object': 'chat.completion', 'choices': [{'index': 0, 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{\\n  \"summary\": \"Be Obsessed or Be Average by Grant Cardone is a motivational book that emphasizes the importance of obsession in achieving success.

       "   'content': 'You are tasked with extracting relevant information or identification from the following key-value pairs. Given a piece of text, chapterize and generate a JSON format as output. Follow the instructions below to help you in generating the output:\\n\\n1. **Understand the Key-Value Structure:**\\n   - A key-value pair consists of:\\n      - `\\'summary\\'`: A top-level overview or description of the chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'headers\\'`: A list of headers where a header is a line of text that introduces a new section or chapter in a document. It is typically formatted distinctly from the main body text to stand out, often being bolder, in a larger font, or differently styled. Headers are concise, summarizing the content that follows, and they guide the reader through the document\\'s structure. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'subheaders\\'`: A list of subheaders where subheaders are similar to headers but usually introduce subsections within a larger section. They are often formatted to be slightly less prominent than main headers, but still distinct from the body text. Strictly, this is a list of strings. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'named_entities\\'`: A list of dictionary of named entities identified in the text. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'keypoints\\'`: A list of the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given text chunk. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n      - `\\'tonality\\'`: The overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Must not be empty (i.e., required).\\n\\n2. **Extract Relevant Information:**\\n   - Focus on extracting the most relevant information or identification from each chunk. This could include key themes, essential concepts, or significant details.\\n\\n3. **Perform Named Entity Recognition:**\\n   - Extract named entities from a given text and organize the results, providing the option for individual descriptions for each entity. \\n   - As part of the information extraction, identify and categorize any named entities, including but not limited to PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, etc., within the text.\\n   - The system should present the extracted entities in a structured format, allowing for detailed descriptions or additional information for each identified entity.  \\n   - Follow exactly the example below for the named entities:\\n\\n      named_entities = [\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_1>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_1>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1a>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_2>\", \"description\": \"<Description_1b>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with individual descriptions as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         {\\n            \"<Tag_2>\": [\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_3>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  {\"entity\": \"<Entity_4>\", \"description\": \"<Description_2>\"},\\n                  # Add more entities with a common description as needed\\n            ]\\n         },\\n         # Add more entries as needed\\n      ]\\n   \\n   <Tag_1> and <Tag_2> represent different types of named entities.\\n   Each tag contains a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an entity and its associated description.\\n   Each entity can have an individual description.\\n\\n\\n4. **Determine the Tonality:**\\n   - Assess the overall tone or sentiment of the text chunk, such as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed. Include this assessment under the key `\\'tonality\\'`.\\n\\n5. **Highlight the Keypoints:**\\n   - Identify and list the most important elements or essential information conveyed in the given chunk under the key `\\'keypoints\\'`.\\n\\n6. **Header Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical to headers of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Look for any title case or all uppercase.\\n      - Position: Consider if any text is at the beginning of a section or stands alone.\\n      - Content: Assess if the text is concise and focused.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Note any numbering or special symbols.\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if any text introduces a new topic or section.\\n\\n7. **Subheader Detection:**\\n   - Analyze the text for characteristics typical of subheaders of a document:\\n      - Capitalization: Subheaders often follow title case, but they might not always be in all uppercase, unlike some main headers.\\n      - Position: Check if the text appears within a section, usually following a main header. Subheaders are often used to introduce subtopics within a larger section.\\n      - Content: Determine if the text is more specific than a main header but still concise. It should elaborate on the content introduced by the main header.\\n      - Numbering/Symbols: Look for secondary or nested numbering or bullet points (e.g., \"1.1 Subsection\", \"• Subpoint\").\\n      - Contextual Relevance: Evaluate if the text refines or narrows down the topic introduced by the main header, rather than introducing a completely new topic.\\n\\n8. **Generate Tags**\\n   - Please generate tags based on the given relevant information and strictly refrain from generating empty tags or empty array.\\n\\n9. **Provide Clear Details:**\\n   - Clearly present the information extracted from the piece of text. Ensure that the details are concise and informative.\\n\\n10. **Strict JSON Response:**\\n   - Strictly format your response as a JSON object. Each key-value pair should adhere to the specified structure.\\n\\n         Example Key-Value Pair:\\n            {\\n               \"summary\": \"It explores potential applications and future directions of research, including constructing dynamic knowledge graphs for specialized verticals, enhancing KGTransformer capabilities using self-supervised learning, combining language models with knowledge graphs, comparing graph learning techniques with traditional time-series models, and architectural improvements to KGTransformer.\",\\n               \"headers\": [\"Introduction\", \"Methodology\", \"Discussion\"],\\n               \"subheaders\": [\"Introduction to the Study\", \"Background and Context\", \"Research Methodology\", \"Implications of Results\", \"Future Research Directions\"],\\n               \"named_entities\": \\n                  [\\n                     {\\n                        \"Persons\": [\\n                              {\"entity\": \"John Doe\", \"description\": \"Lead author of the study\"},\\n                              {\"entity\": \"Jane Smith\", \"description\": \"Co-author and contributor\"}\\n                        ]\\n                     },\\n                     {\\n                        \"Organization\": [\\n                              {\"entity\": \"7Gen\", \"description\": \"Primary research organization\"},\\n                              {\"entity\": \"XYZ Foundation\", \"description\": \"Supporting foundation\"}\\n                        ]\\n                     },\\n                     {\\n                        \"Location\": [\\n                              {\"entity\": \"New York\", \"description\": \"Study conducted in New York\"},\\n                              {\"entity\": \"London\", \"description\": \"Collaboration with researchers in London\"}\\n                        ]\\n                     }\\n                  ],\\n               \"keypoints\": [\"Recent breakthroughs in machine learning\", \"Advancements in neural network technologies\", \"Ethical considerations in AI development\"],\\n               \"tonality\": \"Mixed\",\\n               \"tags\": [\"AI\", \"machine learning\", \"neural network\", \"graph\", \"research\"]\\n            }\\n\\nYour task is to strictly generate a JSON response that extracts and presents relevant information or identification for each key-value pair.

       "   'content': 'Here is the text passage: She told\\nhim, “I’m your secret girl, and you are my secret boy, nee?”\\n\\nOne afternoon, about four months in, Solomon came over\\nto the apartment and found Hana waiting for him wearing\\nflesh-colored lingerie and high heels. She looked like a petite-\\nsized centerfold in Playboy. “Do you have any money, Solomon?” she asked. “Yeah, sure. Why?”\\n\\n“I want some. I have to buy things to turn you on. Like this. Pretty, nee?”\\n\\nSolomon tried to embrace her, but she pushed her left hand\\nout gently. “Money, please. ”\\n\\nSolomon pulled out his billfold and took out a thousand-\\nyen note. “What do you need it for?” he asked. “I just do. Do you have any more?”\\n\\n“Uh, sure. ” Solomon pulled out the emergency five-\\nthousand-yen note that he kept folded in a square behind the\\nwallet-sized photograph of his mother. His father told him he\\nalways had to have some money just in case something\\nimportant came up. “Give it to Hana-chan, please. ”\\n\\nSolomon handed it to her, and Hana put it on the table with\\nthe thousand-yen note. Hana walked slowly to the shelf where Etsuko kept a radio\\nand fiddled with the channels until she found a pop song she\\nliked. She bent over and started swaying her hips in time to the\\nmusic, making sure that he was watching her. Solomon went\\nto her, and she turned around and unbuttoned his jeans. Without saying a word, she pushed him into the armchair near\\nher and got on her knees. Solomon never knew what she was\\ngoing to do. Hana slid the straps of her lace-trimmed brassiere over her\\nshoulders and pulled out her breasts over the small cups so he\\ncould see her nipples. He tried to touch them, but she swatted\\nhim away. With her hands cradling his bottom, she started to\\nsuck him. When he was done, he saw that she was crying. “Hana-chan, what’s the matter?”\\n\\n“Go home, Solomon. ”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“You’re finished. ”\\n\\n“I came to see you. What’s this all about?”\\n\\n“Go home, Solomon! You’re just this little boy who wants\\nto fuck. I need money, and this isn’t enough. What am I going\\nto do?”\\n\\n“What are you talking about?”\\n\\n“Go home and do your homework. Go have dinner with\\nyour daddy and granny! You’re all the same. I’m just a kid\\nwith divorced parents. You think I’m nothing. You think I’m a\\nloser because my mother was the town whore. ”\\n\\n“What are you talking about? Why are you mad at me? I\\ndon’t think that, Hana. I could never think that. You can come\\nover, too. I thought you were going to your mother’s restaurant\\nafter I left. ”\\n\\nHana covered her breasts and went to the bathroom to get\\nher robe. She returned, wearing a red yukata. She got really\\n\\n\\n\\nquiet, then told him to get more money and come back the\\nnext day. “Hana, we are friends, nee? I love you. All the money I\\nhave, you can have. I have cash at home from my birthday\\npresents, but my grandmother keeps it for me in her bureau. I\\ncan’t take it out all at once. What do you need it for?”\\n\\n“I have to go, Solomon. I can’t stay here anymore. I have to\\nbe independent. ”\\n\\n“Why? No. You can’t go. ”\\n\\nEvery day and night, he had been thinking of what he could\\ndo for work so they could live together. They were too young\\nto marry, but he thought that after he graduated from high\\nschool, he could get a job and he could take care of her. He\\nwould marry her. Once, she had said that if she married, she\\nwould never divorce, because she could never do that to her\\nchildren. Her brothers and she had been treated worse than\\nlepers after her mother left, she’d said. But Solomon’s father\\nwanted him to go to college in America. How could he leave\\nher behind? He wondered if she would come with him. They\\ncould marry after he finished college. “Solomon, I’m going to go to Tokyo and get a real life. I’m\\nnot going to stay in this apartment and wait for a fifteen-year-\\nold to come and fuck me. ”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“I have to do something with my life. Yokohama is stupid,\\nand I’d rather be dead than return to Hokkaido. ”\\n\\n“How about that school your mom found?”\\n\\n“I can’t go to school. I’m not smart like you. I want to be\\non television, like those girls in the dramas, but I don’t know\\nhow to act. I can’t sing, either. I have a terrible voice. ”\\n\\n“Maybe you can learn how to act and sing. Aren’t there\\nschools for that? Can’t we ask your mom to find you a\\nschool?”\\n\\nHana brightened for a moment, then looked disappointed\\n\\n\\n\\nagain. “She’d just think it’s foolish. She wouldn’t help me. Not for\\nthat. Besides, I can’t read well, and you have to be able to read\\nyour lines and memorize them. I saw this really good actress\\ninterviewed on TV, and she said that she works really hard at\\nreading and memorizing. I’m not good at anything—except\\nsex. But what do I do when I’m not pretty anymore?”\\n\\n“You’ll always be beautiful, Hana. ”\\n\\nShe laughed. “No, dummy. Women lose their looks fast. My mother is\\nlooking old. She better keep your dad. She’s not going to do\\nany better. ”\\n\\n“Can you work for your mom?”\\n\\n“No, I’d rather die. I hate the smell of shoyu and oil in my\\nhair. It’s disgusting. I can’t imagine bowing all day to lazy, fat\\ncustomers who complain about nothing. She hates the\\ncustomers, too. She’s a hypocrite. ”\\n\\n“Etsuko is not like that. ”\\n\\n“That’s because you don’t know her. ”\\n\\nSolomon stroked her hair, and Hana opened her robe and\\nslipped off her panties. “Can you do it now? Again?” she asked. “I need that thing\\ninside me, you know? It’s always better the second time,\\nbecause it lasts longer. ”\\n\\nSolomon touched her, and he could. Every day, she asked for money, and every day he gave her\\nsome of his birthday money from the bureau until there was no\\nmore left. Whenever he came over, she wanted to try things,\\neven when it hurt her a lot, because she told him that she\\nneeded to master this. Even if he didn’t like a certain method,\\nshe made him practice it and play certain roles. She learned\\nhow to make sounds and to talk the way girls talked in sex\\nmovies. A week after the money ran out, Solomon found a\\n\\n\\n\\nnote she had hidden in his pencil case: “One day, you will find\\na really good girl, not someone like me. I promise. But it was\\nfun, nee? I am your dirty flower, Soro-chan. ” That afternoon,\\nSolomon ran to Etsuko’s apartment, and he learned that she\\nwas gone. He didn’t see her again until three years later when\\nshe met him at a famous unagiya in Tokyo to give him a\\nsweater before he went to college in New York. 15\\nNew York, 1985\\n\\nWhere are you?” Solomon asked in Japanese. “Your mom\\ndoesn’t know where you are. Everyone’s worried. ”\\n\\n“I don’t want to talk about her,” Hana replied. “So you have\\na girlfriend-o now?”\\n\\n“Yes,” Solomon answered without thinking. “Hana, are you\\nokay?” No matter how many drinks she’d had, she tended to\\nsound sober. “Tell me about her. Is she Japanese?”\\n\\n“No. ” Solomon wanted to keep her on the line. About five\\nyears before, after she moved out of Etsuko’s apartment, she\\ntook a long string of hostessing jobs in Tokyo, refusing to tell\\nanyone where she lived. Etsuko didn’t know what to do\\nanymore; she’d hired an investigator but had little luck\\ntracking her down. “Hana, tell me where you are, and please\\ncall your mother—”\\n\\n“Shut up, college boy. Or else I’ll hang up. ”\\n\\n“Oh, Hana. Why?” He had to smile, having missed even\\nher petulance. “Why are you so difficult, Hana-chan?”\\n\\n“And why are you so far away?”\\n\\nHana poured herself a smaller glass of wine, and Solomon\\nheard the glug of the liquid hitting the glass. It was morning in\\nTokyo, and she was sitting on the bare floor of her tiny\\napartment in Roppongi, which she shared with three other\\nhostesses. Two were sleeping off the whiskey tea from the\\nnight before, and the third hadn’t returned home from a date. “I miss you, Solomon. I miss my old friend. You were my\\nonly friend. You know that?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“You’re drinking. Are you okay?”\\n\\n“I like to drink. Drinking makes me happy. I’m very good\\nat drinking. ” She laughed and swallowed a thimbleful of wine. She wanted to make the bottle last.'}],\n",
